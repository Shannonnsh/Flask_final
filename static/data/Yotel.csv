Hotel Orchard Road Singapore,"All facets of experience staying at Yotel Orchard Road Singapore were excellent, from booking through, checking in, enjoying the room and it's facilities to checking out. A totally pleasant experience. Highly recommended for discerning travellers. ",50,Oct-22,Undisclosed,9,6
Great hub to explore Singapore from,"Brilliant price in a brilliant location. Rooms are as per the website suggests - small. An absolutely brilliant hub to explore Singapore from, but perhaps not somewhere to stay if you intend on spending lots of time in the room itself. Staff were very attentive and helpful. Robots were super cool!! Very close to the metro, which is very easy and intuitive to use.",50,Aug-22,Travelled as a couple,15,3
good location hotel,"good location hotel, highly recommended hotel. staffs are very friendly and accommodating. food at the 10th floor restaurant was good, unfortunately we only tried it ones, wish we ate there more often. we checked out at 11am and we had our luggages deposited at the concierge, and in the afternoon before leaving the hotel, we were able to use the lobby bathroom to freshen up, though we were told that we can even take a shower at the 10th floor before leaving if we wanted too, thats a big plus especially for travelers who has a late flight schedule.

Nice place to stay,The hotel is really nice and cool at the same time that includes the robot to lessen the physical contact since we're still at the covid era. Really worth the money. We chose the adjoining room since we're 6 of us in the family. And the location of the hotel is pretty good too.,50,Oct-22,Undisclosed,2,0
Short getaway with friends,"Great stay and would definitely stay here again. Location is convenient, easy access to public transport. Comfortable bed and room cleanliness is great. Wide range of TV channels to watch while relaxing in the room.",50,Oct-22,Undisclosed,1,0
Compact Cribs,"Whilst this is a compact room it has everything you need. Nice and clean and fresh and super comfy beds.  Perfect location for shopping on orchard road, we loved it and would stay again.  Breakfast was great with so many options to choose from.",40,Oct-22,Undisclosed,1,0
Awesome Modern Hotel in Orchard Road of Singapore,Nicely located in the Orchard Road of Singapore. just 2-3mins walk to MRT stations that connects u everywhere. Lots of foods and shopping options. Thou it was not that easy to locate it kind of walk detoured path. Maybe the hotel can consider some sort of directional vids for those guests who arrives to the hotel via the MRT. ,50,Oct-22,Undisclosed,196,67
Convenient Stay,"The hotel is as described. It’s a newer hotel and the location can’t be beat. The hotel is right on orchard and really easy to get to the mrt, bus or grab a taxi. The rooms are very small but has everything you need. The bathroom has privacy but is one step away from the bed. If I was traveling with someone that I wasn’t extremely close with then I probably would have felt awkward. We arrived early in the morning and were able to store our luggage at the hotel until check in. Overall, it’s a great spot to stay when visiting Singapore.",40,Oct-22,Travelled as a couple,5,0
Excellent Hotel,"clean hotel with great facilities (gym, swimming pool, etc.). the location is very strategic and near to MRT station. it is a cool hotel with hi technology. the bed was very comfortable. the amenities was great.  one thing that needs to be improved is the cleaning should be performed daily instead of every 3 days, at least any collection for trash daily. overall was great, perfect and fantastic.",50,Oct-22,Undisclosed,3,4
"Great location, bed. Nothing else","10/10 for location and accessibility. Bed was one of the most confortable ones I’ve ever slept in. However I would not recommend Yotel if you are a clean freak or looking to maximize the facilities in a hotel. All you can do are literally sleep and take a shower and nothing else, due to the size of the room. Hope the hotel invests in cleanliness / adding staff, instead of fancy robots who cannot clean. but otherwise had a good stay. ",30,Sep-22,Undisclosed,1,0
Unimpressed.,"If you are looking for a 'Premier Inn' type of stay then it's OK - at a push. If you want a nice hotel, in a lovely city, book elsewhere. The robots are gimmicky and to be honest, a complete pain, as they monopolise the lifts and cause you a delay of up to 4 minutes - not funny if you are trying to keep to an appointment.",10,Sep-22,Travelled on business,2,0
Yotel SG 2022,Very cool and technologically advanced but not for families. I would book it again it if I was travelling alone or with a partner but not when a big group or with a family. I hope the restaurant opens until late (after 12AM) because most bars in SG close at 12.,40,Oct-22,Undisclosed,1,0
Very well located hotel!,"If the hotel is equipped with a smart TV and more suitable mattress, I would give it a perfect score. The room is smaller than I anticipated so we have to be very efficient on utilizing the space. The bathroom is good and the location is the best.",40,Oct-22,Undisclosed,2,0
The happiest coolest place in Singapore,"An amazing hotel with a beautiful city view, Great accessibility and in the most wonderful location.

Good location,"Very good location, rooms are small and beds not so comfortable but the room is very clean.i would go back for sure. Just right across ion orchard, plenty of restaurants around the area. Very near the mrt station.",40,Sep-22,Undisclosed,1,0
Quite Content,"The location is good. The best aspect for our stay this time. Service is also good, adding robot is a  interesting attraction. The (large) bed condition is questionable though... and we really wish the house keeping department can help vacuum the room every day. When women stay together, there will be lots of hair fall on the floor.",30,Sep-22,Undisclosed,3,2
Fabulous cool hotel in perfect location,"We were 3 and we booked the room with bunkbed. I absolutely love my bunkbed! Beds are comfortable, hotel and room were soooo clean! Komyuniti is superb with helpful staffs, ANNIE especially. Thank you ANNIE! 🌹 Breakfast has lots of varieties, since we stayed there for 7days. Congee is a must try! 🫕  adorable YOSHI AND YOLANDA!   They cleaned the rooms every 3days, sheets are comfy too. Malls are surrounding the hotel, vibrant place to stay.  Easy checkout.  Can’t wait to come back!",50,Sep-22,Travelled with family,14,12
Great location and stay,The location was easy to get around in Singapore. MRT and buses are nearby to get to the main attractions. Convenience stores were nearby as well so it was easy to pick up snacks and a sim card. The queen city view room was good value.,50,Sep-22,Undisclosed,1,0
Would return for business trips.,"Location was great - right in the centre of the shopping district. Good amenities were provided, and the service was impeccable. I'd left an item behind, and was contacted within the same day by the staff. ",50,Sep-22,Travelled on business,1,0
Pleasent stay.,"Had a top floor balcony  city view room. Was cleaned and changed every day of stay. We stayed a week. Had issue with the sink plug not working on 2 nd night of our stay. Was sorted very quickly as was the air con unit which need a new filter. Bed and pillows very comfortable. Only issue for the whole stay was other guests not wearing masks in the small lifts. Robots delivering room service  entertained me, so cool.",50,Sep-22,Undisclosed,1,0
Good Location,It was a good stay and comfortable. Location is fantastic.service is fast. I wish the rooms were a bit bigger for families like us.gym and swimming are also okay.A bit on the expensive site mostly due to oocation.,40,Sep-22,Undisclosed,2,0
Not suitable for families,"While this hotel has a fantastic location, the hotel is not interested in catering for families.  When we booked our two rooms, I requested interconnecting rooms.  When we arrived at check in, I specified again that we wanted interconnecting rooms. The guy said he couldn’t tell yet if they were interconnecting. He rushed us through the whole check in process - when I asked again when he handed us the keys, he said he didn’t know if they were interconnecting. When we got to our rooms, we found that they weren’t interconnecting.   This hotel is definitely not suited to families, unless you want to spend a whole lot of time split in two groups.",20,Sep-22,Undisclosed,6,9
New hotel,"The room was small, but still it was a pleasant stay over all. It is near MRT Orchard station, by passing by the ION Patterson Link. Bus station is also near, and easily found by Grab.   Easy check in and check out via the kiosks on the hotel entrance.  Overall, it is located in a convenient location 🙂",50,Sep-22,Travelled on business,3,0
Not a pleasant stay,Should Maintenace hotel room in good quality conditions. (After years)  Floors are not proper vacuum. There is no face towels and hand towel provided in the room when checked in.  1) Went down to the reception counter for face towels and hand towel. Realized after I was given a floor towel.  2) Next given a hand towel with stains. (Unacceptable and unprofessional)  ,20,Sep-22,Undisclosed,1,0
A cool experience,Everything is expensive in Singapore. Looking for a reasonable priced hotel to stay that is near orchard is not easy. Yotel is a compact yet well designed hotel that satisfies this requirement. Overall a wonderful experience. ,40,Sep-22,Undisclosed,1,0
"No cleaning while you stay, bathroom block the view","No cleaning while I had stay for 4 days. I had to aske to clean the floor but the bin I had to clean on my own. For 4 days stay, the bathroom was dirty. and the bathroom block the view. It was too small for 2 persons. I had to have my tea in the bathroom because the room was full of stuffs. ",20,Sep-22,Travelled on business,1,0
Cool hotel,Easy online check-in and staff was very helpful to assist us. Essentials were readily available in the cute room and love the bed with clean white beddings. Just want to suggest to have a garbage can in the restroom and cleaning the rooms should be every 2 days. Amazed by the speedy  delivery of requested items  by the robots. ,40,Sep-22,Undisclosed,1,0

A futuristic cabin,"Self-check-in on the computer at the hotel lobby. Robot will send you extra water or a coffee cup to replace the housekeeping. However, you are still able to feel the warm in this hotel from the friendly and helpful staff.  ",40,Sep-22,Travelled on business,1,0
Average stay,Great location in the center of the high-end shopping district. Compact rooms. Friendly and helpful staff. Terrible beds- poor quality mattress that couldnt be changed so instead they came to put a wood plank on top of the mattress.,30,Sep-22,Undisclosed,1,0
Great place to stay,"Great little hotel in a great location. Yes, the rooms are small but very manageable.   Staff are amazing. I would definitely stay again at this hotel.   Breakfast had a good selection, just be wary of your booking if it supplies breakfast as most of the bookings are for 1 person, meaning 1 free breakfast only even if two of you are in the room.   MRT is a 5 min walk on orchard road.",50,Sep-22,Travelled as a couple,32,23
The room is really smalll,"It's not everyday cleaning room, and the room is so small, just the location convenient and smart devices. Need to call for refill water or change towel everyday. I think it's suitable for 2 ppl and short staying only. ",30,Sep-22,Undisclosed,1,0
Rude manager and unhelpful front desk,"While the location was good, the first impression of the hotel was horrible as I met with staff seated in-front dressed in a brown coat. He was rude and unhelpful when approached. I tried asking him about baggage storage as I arrived earlier than the check-in time. Without listening to my concern, he brushed me off and gave an unwarranted response by saying, ""early check-in is SGD100"". Was this really necessary when the customer was not even requesting for that? That left such a horrible first impression on the hotel. Indeed, during check-out, he came by and snapped to rush the process when there were no one else doing check out. He acted as if the customer should by heart know the steps to perform self check out without even reading the screen. Please train or improve the…",10,Sep-22,Undisclosed,1,0
Great value for money hotel in perfect location,"I thought the hotel looked cool and something a little bit different from the norm. It was a lot cheaper than the other hotels but definitely did not feel like a compromise.  Hotel is in a great location, it's clean and modern, staff are always friendly. Good selection of food at any time of the day - I recommend the lunch deal if you are spending the day at the hotel. Room was clean, and quiet, loved the rain shower and the views from the balcony. Pool and gym were a good size. Overall great experience and would definitely stay at Yotel again.",50,Sep-22,Undisclosed,1,0

Yotel Stay for a family of six - September 2022,"We had a great time at Yotel! It's conveniently located along Orchard road near the big malls. Just a 4-5 minute walk from the train station. The rooms we had were nicely sleek and modern. The beds were super comfy especially after a long day of walking. Our rooms were adjoined, so it's an added bonus for us. Expect the rooms to be a bit cramped though; but everything you might need in a hotel room is there. Will surely consider Yotel again when we're back in Singapore :)",50,Sep-22,Undisclosed,5,0

SMALL BUT WELL EQUIPPED ROOM,"Small hotel off orchard rd, clean and modern. Finding taxi or grab could be really hard sometimes. Room only cleaned every 3 days. Pool is just average, nothing special.

worst hotel ever,"One of the worst hotels ever. I did not expect this hotel to be of such a poor standard and lacks privacy and shocking room size, which is not suitable for human use. My advice to everyone who seeks privacy, comfort and cleanliness is to stay away from this hotel and the only positive thing is that it is close to Orchard Street.",10,Sep-22,Undisclosed,2,0
Great stay in a great location,"Had the pleasure of staying in this affordable hotel. Was In a very good location close to the Orchard Rd shopping junction and MRT. The room was clean and served its purpose great, it is however a bit small. Our balcony on the highest level had a fantastic view especially at night. The pool was great for a swim after walking around all day, nothing spectacular but nice, and the cocktails from Komunity bar were also nice and not too expensive. The staff were also very helpful, helped with check in, kept our bags stored away on day of check out (as our flight was late at night) and organised a taxi whenever needed!

"Tiny compact room, novel room arrangement but not everything worked","the hotel room I had was with reclined bed, it might be good for watching TV but not ideal for normal sleeping; the hotel features 2 robots that supposedly bring stuffs to your room and you can pet them, while they appear working the staff said they're sadly broken. Staff generally very responsive and I like that I can print documents for business right at the lobby with no additional charges.",30,Sep-22,Travelled on business,1,0
Quirky Hotel,"Self check in is a bit of a hassle but it was a good experience! Stayed here with my sister and niece. Room is small as expected but I really like the bunk bed (good experience too!) The staffs are really friendly. They gave me a birthday card and some macaroons ♥️ Overall, quirky hotel and would stay here again 😄   PROS - Strategic location - toilet has bidet - many channels for the tv - they have mini fridge - iron and ironing board provided in the room  CONS - Room is really small but it was alright - The floor is slightly dirty - Slow shower drain after 3 days",40,Aug-22,Travelled with family,33,5
Great location. Friendly and helpful staff. Value for money,"Stayed there for 6 nights and I must say this hotel has the most efficient self check-in system in place. It look only 5 minute (or less).  All the staff are so friendly and helpful. Always with a smile on their face.  Room is a little small and the cleanliness has rooms for improvements.

Small rooms with BIG features,"This futuristic-concept hotel offered a lot of surprising elements that maximized the small space.   Check-in was quick and easy, thanks to the self-check that allowed you to book, retrieve booking, register and take your key yourself. A staff was always on hand to assist. For those on the more “traditional” sense, other counters are also on hand to check-in with the staff.   Room 2312 was my room number for this trip. Yes, it was small but it had everything I needed, even space for my large luggage to open.   A wall had the entertainment center but also had integrated clothes hooks, cabinet for ironing board, a cabinet for umbrella (yes!) and a flashlight, a foldout desk, water bottle counter and bottle opener.

Stay at YOTEL,The negative point is that the room is cleaned once every 3 days and the room is small and inconvenient. But it means I chose the wrong hotel because it didn't suit my circumstances of having to work. Everything else was fine.,30,Aug-22,Undisclosed,1,0
Dirty,"the hotel is in a good location but the room are very narrow and too much dirty. For example, I found hairs in the bed  and in the only two drawers that are in the room, and the room was not ever cleaned during my permanence (2 nights)",20,Aug-22,Undisclosed,1,0
Cool and new hotel with great location,"Yotel Singapore  Great things:  * Even the room size is small (like most of the Singapore Hotels) but it functions very well.

Best PADs near Orchard shopping area,"Only a walking distance from vibrant shopping area of Orchard road and Mount Elizabeth hospital.

Meh. Bad sleep.,"This hotel looks cool and is in a good location but it’s horrible on the fundamentals.   The bed is soooo bad. Zero support. No springs and horrible foam. If you sleep on the side, it sinks down like a pillow and you are sleeping on a slant. It only works if you are single and sleeping in the middle of the bed.   The service is horrible. The people are unfriendly, don’t speak and could care less. When I complained about the bed, the lady offered another bed (which was exactly the same) in another room, or to put a wooden board under the bed.

Overpriced based on our experience,"My partner and I feel we overpaid on our visit. For starters, the Robots down for the entire 6 night stay so had to collect everything we needed from reception, not the worst thing to ever happen but as a hotel that sells the whole robot experience, we felt let down by this. Add watered down soap and no robes in our room also among other things and we really started to question the money we spent. Not an experience all will have I’m sure, but unfortunately what we had. Not awful by any means, just room for improvement. Beds however were very comfortable so at least we got a good nights sleep every night which is the main thing I guess.",30,Aug-22,Undisclosed,7,8

Nice budget hotel,Surprisingly nice for the price! The room is small but very ergonomically arranged. The highlight is the bathroom. Floor to ceiling windows for the toilet and shower stall and generously proportioned. The shower was large enough for 2 people and the room was clean.  Wi-Fi was good for work and meetings (30+ mbps).  The bar is a rip off and not worth the price for what you’re getting.

Good Location/Bed & Pillow. Improve cleanliness & facilities maintainance,"The location was excellent (few mins walk to ion & other shopping malls). The bed and pillows were super comfortable. However, the cleanliness must be improved. There was hairs laying around on the floors (suggest to wear in-room slippers immediately) and our towels were stained with mysterious brown stains.

"Good location, nice view, but that's it","Good location, nice view from the bathroom, but otherwise no advantages. Room unpleasantly small. Breakfast absolutely not worth the price: you always had to wait for things to be replenished, queueing at the coffee machine because only one of 3 was working, no alternative for milk (oats, soy, lactose-free milk...nothing), not enough vegetables or healthy products. For $20 I would have expected much more. Room service was charged but not done, linen and towels was not changed, room not cleaned. It was really unpleasant that the linen and bath towels were not changed even once although we pressed the appropriate button.

Great Stay,"the hotel location & services, room cleanliness are meeting expectations. The check-in process is via kiosk, as the booking made via Agoda, would need the team to guide us through the check-in process.  As for the 3-days room cleaning policy (room only be cleaned on 3rd days), it's advisable to notify guests up front at booking confirmation stage as the information was not able to share with everyone and explain clearly during the check-in process, a bit messy when group check-in.

Good location but room size is small,"The self-check-in process was hassle-free and simple to utilize.   The hotel has an interesting and eccentric decor, however the room was somewhat small.

Nice location & design,The location was right for me due to the business reason. Every inch of space inside the room (cabin) was very well-thought & useful.

In a post pandemic period where cleaning is crucial , not cleaning the rooms was funny. Funnier is they do not advertise it anywhere especially during booking.

My very first experience with Once every 3 days hotel in Singapore,"The hotel location and bed are superb, unfortunately, the cleaning service is a bit wierdly bad. They clean your room only once every 3 days, which means you have to ask for extra bottles of drinking water for the 2nd and 3rd day, you need to tidy up your room yourself, you have to ask for new paper cup for coffee and clean your rubbish bin yourself. Consider this as room for rent instead of a hotel. Even worst this thing happen during pandemic time.",20,Jul-22,Undisclosed,1,0

Worth the price,Very central location. Everything was easy. Breakfast just needs variation but over all everything is great. It is also near the bus stop. The burger just outside the building was sooooooooo good. Malls on the side too. Convenient especially for people going home that needs an art test. It is just near far east plaza.,50,May-22,Undisclosed,1,0

Location is good.,"The hotel is situated right in the city centre of Orchard Road. So, if you are looking to stay around Orchard, this hotel would be a good fit. From the hotel, you can walk to a few malls such as Isetan, Tangs, ION Orchard etc. There are underground passes, so rain or sunshine, you will be okay.

MOOLAYIL PARAMESWARAN,"Yotel is ideally located in the centre of the city with easy access to MRT, Shopping Malls, Bus Stops etc. Breakfast at Kommunity is sumptuous, alluring and delicious. A small suggestion is that the room size is extremely small. The balcony is converted into Bathroom, albeit a novel idea, but causes inconvenience to guests.

This had been addressed on a note  in the room which went unread as I had imagined it was the usual please hang the towels etc to0 save water .......

Great for Staycation,"Great location for staycation.  The room we stayed is good for three persons. It is just right if you only expect your stay to always go for outside activities but If you are looking for a spacious room, then you might need to re-consider as there is a constraint on the space.  The service is average overall.  The rooms and the facilities are well kept, clean, and chic.

Clean and compact. Not for big groups. Service was just okay.,"Clean pad, but it’s ideal for people who want to spend the whole day out and come back to a clean room to crash in because of how small it is.   The service at front desk was unhelpful as the staff we dealt with was new and didn’t communicate well even when asked simple questions like, “What’s the problem?” when they were experiencing difficulties with our check-out process. So that was a little frustrating.   The breakfast included in our stay was nice.   We enjoyed our stay overall. ",40,May-22,Undisclosed,1,0

Great location and price but room too small,Can't actually fault anything about the Hotel other than the room was too small but what should I have expected - it was called a Pod - and I can see why. The view from the bathroom was great and the bed very comfortable however I needed to do a fair bit of work on my laptop and there was absolutely no where to do this in the room - I had to go down to the Bar on level 10 to have any room at all. It was definately worth trying but I would happily pay a fair bit more to stay in a larger room next time. I was the only person in the room - if there had been two of us I would have just left and asked for a refund.,30,May-22,Travelled on business,90,36

Good for Solo (or maybe Couple),"I booked this hotel for my staycation after return to Singapore from oversea, I am quite pleased with the overall stay time. The bed is really nice, probably one of the best bed and pillow I ever slept in at hotel. This room, however, is more suitable for single or couple, as the room is small even it is indicate 2pax, it is small and crowded. Also the hand wash /tab sink is locate outside of bathroom, which is a bit weird. But overall is good and location is really awesome.

Service level at lobby is mediocre as some of the staff seems cold(don’t even bother to greet or smile). Upon check out, just ushered to use the kiosk although the frontdesk is available. There is no housekeeping during my 3 days 2 nights stay even when I book two King rooms. I felt that at least they should bother to help guests clear their trashbins. The sofa bed was creaking throughout the night if you move. Pretty uncomfortable. Main bed was good but a tad soft.  I love the Komiyumti restaurant as staff was nice, friendly and polite. Welcome drinks was great.",40,Apr-22,Undisclosed,4,2
Hit Or Miss,"First the positives: location is excellent at the junction between Orchard and Scotts Road. Plenty of shopping and dining options. Wifi was fast and while there were a lot of rooms, the number of lifts was enough that there was not much waiting to go up or down to the room levels. TV had the usual cable channels covering news and info, movies and entertainment. Now the not so good points: room is small, if you have several pieces of luggage you may have little room to move left. There is no place to sit or work unless you used the luggage rack as a workaround bench. Cleaning is not done daily. We stayed 4 days and the rooms were never cleaned. I don't mind that so much but the trash bin in the room is small and fills up fast. Even if you left it in the hallway, it is not picked…",40,May-22,Travelled with family,198,164

Bed had an automatic uplift at the back and that was quite nice as I could watch the TV while sitting up straight. Had quite a few nice channels on the TV so I watched a few movies. Bed was also extremely soft, so I could roll around it and enjoy how fluffy it was. Location was excellent, it was just 5 to 10mins from Orchard mrt station. I managed to buy McDonald's and brought it back to my hotel room. Unfortunately, there was no table or chair so I could only eat on the bed. Toilet was very cool and had a nice large window outside.

Worst Hotel Experience in My Life,"You cant have a better location than this as it is just 2 mins walk to orchard road.  However, the room was absolutely trash. The room was so dirty that we found cockroach in the room (as shown in the photo, there is a Yotel sticker on the switch to prove this was indeed taken in Yotel). This is also the first hotel I have ever been that does not provide housekeeping service. There is a ""please make up my room"" button but the room was not cleaned throughout our 4D3N stay.  Also, the gimmicky bed was a hell for anyone with a spine. The mattress was so soft that when the it was flattened down (there is a switch for you to elevate the head of the bed), it became a C shaped mattress. This was literally worse than lying on the ground, which was not an option due to the limited space…",10,Apr-22,Travelled with family,3,2
Staycation at YOTEL,I really like how the hotel looks very futuristic. Cleanliness of the hotel room was what I liked the most. Paid extra for the view and it was worth it. Made a special request for the robot to sing Happy Birthday for my boyfriend and it did happen that was really enjoyable. I love the cabin guide on the television.

WORST EXPERIENCE,I never recommend this property as a 4 start hotel. The rooms are very small and difficult to accommodate to adults in the room. The wash rooms are also smelly as there was no ventilation provided. You can also hear the sound of other water flows and thereby the feeling you get that you live inside the wash room.   The Bed arrangement is terrible as all the beds in the hotel are folding beds. Therefore you cannot have a comfortable sleep.   The Breakfast was absolutely disastrous as there was no buffet. Even the alacarte menu has no choice and had to experience the same menu for 6 days. ,10,Apr-22,Undisclosed,5,2

Cosy wi,"Did a solo staycation in the Premium Cabin with view, and found the room to very cost and perfect for a single guest looking to spend time alone. Location was tucked behind International Building which kind of hid the hotel but signs from outside was adequate to guide anyone from Orchard MRT to the hotel. In-room equipment were good although the bed could be a little firmer for more comfort, though its understandable due to the reclining aspect of the bed which causes a sunken, deep crease when you recline it fully into a bed. FOX channels on the TV guide should be updated, and the hotel should enable mobile-to-tv cast via same wifi other than the Miracast and screen mirroring (via an app) option.

Yotel Review,"Room prices was reasonable provided that the location was just behind Shaw House. However, the mattress was not so good. It was note levelled and it felt like I was going to fall off the bed. The mattress was a little elevated when we pressed the button to lay it flat. Food wise, kitchen was not halal and has pork food items so that was a downside. Service and cleanliness was superb. To those who are driving, the carpark does not belong to Yotel so the price of parking fees are super expensive. We also do not get complimentary parking ticket so we have to buy parking ticket for $21+. ",40,Mar-22,Undisclosed,1,0
Wonderful location but sad rooms,"Good location and staff are responsive, polite and nice. However,  rooms are just sad, and the bed is bad too. Hence the room is not worth the price.

Hotel with great service but lack of basics.,Service was excellent but the bed was uneven to sleep. Space is small for family. Curtain blinds has dead bugs all over.

Good for a one night solo staycation,"Generally ok, but wouldn't recommend more than a night or two. Size of cabin is great for only a person or maybe 2 people max. Cleanliness of cabin could really be improved as blinds were fairly dirty, and entire cabin was quite dusty (even the bed and pillow!). I don't know if it's just me having sensitive skin but i started itching a few hours into my stay and didn't sleep well as my entire body started itching after going under the blanket during bedtime.  It is good that the bed is adjustable to either a sleeping or sitting position but do take note that because of this, the bed has a sunken point (at the point of bending) when bed is in sleeping position. Had a very uncomfortable night sleeping due to this. Aircon also kept adjusting on its own and it got really hot…",40,Mar-22,Undisclosed,2,0

The staff has also come across as very friendly and helpful. Only a small point: the design of the bathroom and the water outflow can be improved as, each time one uses the shower, it would leave the floor soaking wet leading to water bonding.

Too Hot or Too Cold,"Aircon: motion detecting so if you need aircon throughout your sleep, you better be a sleepwalker because mine seemed to turn off few times a night until I throw a few kicks from my bed.  Shower: too cold to start then takes more than 5 minutes only to turn scalding hot. Will take even longer to try and adjust to an acceptable temperature.  Location: Extremely convenient",20,Feb-22,Undisclosed,2,0

YOTEL Staycay Review,Staycay at YOTEL was nice but the rooms are really small. Pool is not open 24/7 so do check out the opening and closing hours.Would also be great if the rooms had a table big enough for laptops and had electrical sockets near the bed for charging purposes. There was only one electrical socket next to the bed which was for the kettle. ,30,Feb-22,Undisclosed,1,0

Even though my request could not be fulfilled, Yotel staff was very responsive on email and explained why it could not be done. Really appreciate that. There was a long queue when I arrived during check-in, but queue management was extremely efficient. Registration was not limited to counters only, but there were proactive staff walking around to ease the pressure on the counters. Maybe self service kiosks can be used for check in?

Room is small and cosy, but may not be suitable for those who are used to/prefer bigger rooms.

Enjoyed the view , just that when you had to use the toilet / shower , you have to remember to draw the blinds else it would be free entertainment . Though I think the nearest tall Building is a tad too far to really see anything !   Had a queen size bed which was comfortable and it had up/ down buttons to lift the headrest part of the bed which was very useful !

My 10-year old daughter loved the smartness of the design, especially the bunk bed. Breakfast was not buffet style but the portion was good. The location was ideal as the hotel was liked to international Building and next to Shaw Centre.

The check in process was very slow so you may want to come as early as about 2pm. While it seemed to be a ""smart"" hotel which it was sort of what it is, bear in mind that they only have charging plugs by one side of the bed and if you want extra ports, you may have to go find it around the room which wasn't so convenient.

Great hotel staycation.,"The room size was acceptable to me. It was clean and ambience of the room was good. The hotel crews were friendly. Though the room may be small, it has everything that I need. Only thing is that it doesn't has a ""proper"" table for you to dine in.

Review for YOTEL,"Most of the service staffs were not friendly at all and sounded impatient when explaining the check out options. Room was not available even though we checked in close to 5pm, had to wait for another 40mins to check in. Service recovery was poor as well for the delay in room. ",30,Nov-21,Undisclosed,1,0
Get a room with balcony!,"I booked the Premium City View Queen Room with balcony for 4 nights, mainly for work purposes.  The room is tiny but well-stocked with amenities. The mattress and pillows, as mentioned by many travellers here, are very soft, so I would not recommend this hotel if you have a bad back.  The balcony added much needed space and sunlight into the room so do upgrade to a room with a balcony. It was also nice to get some fresh air in between Zoom meetings.  There is no housekeeping service unless you are staying for minimum 5 days. Your room is only cleaned on the 4th day. You can ask for extra bottles of water and towels in the meantime. What I did was I bagged my own trash everyday and threw them in the bin downstairs. I also made my bed every morning and hosed down the bathroom…",40,Nov-21,Travelled solo,429,36

"Rushed, Tension-riddled Check-in","Booked the place for it’s prime location over the long Diwali weekend. Met with a long queue upon arrival at 2PM. Waited for a whole hour before we even reached the lobby. Self check-in system was utterly rubbish, had to rely on the staff ultimately which probably resulted in the backed-up queue. Would really urge the Management to relook its systems if it wants to market itself as a SmartStay.  Was informed that room wouldn’t be ready until minimally minutes later due to short staff and more stringent checks. Had to store luggage somewhere else as we had other bookings to go to. Apologies from the staff (probably not their fault anyway) but no real action on ratification. Got a call 2 hours after supposed official check-in time at 4PM that room was ready.  Room was pretty small…",30,Nov-21,Undisclosed,1,0
Bad experience,"Bad experience, mainly due to the service of the staffs. Check-in time stated was 3pm, so we reached around 2:30pm. There was already a long queue waiting to check-in. Finally our turn to the counter but was told that the rooms are not ready yet. Ended up getting our rooms around 4:30pm. What’s worse is the staff at the front-desk sounded very sarcastic and ingenue. Despite the long wait and delay of check-in, we received a call from the front desk on the day of our check-out saying that there will be a charge if we don’t check-out in the next 10mins. (12:30pm at that point of time, but was told that we could check out at 1pm the day before lol)   Service at the restaurant was also slow and they seem very short handed.

YOTEL is generally ok,"Expect the room to be very small, but the view from the room was generally ok, the location is easy to find. The staffs are friendly and helpful except that the staff in their restaurant they serve food slowly. Price wise I'd say such a small room charging almost 200 is a little too high. So think twice of what you need before booking here. ",40,Oct-21,Undisclosed,1,0

Only stay for the great location,"I’ve stayed at Yotel in New York and I enjoyed the concept of the hotel and my stay there that when I had to choose a hotel with a convenient location for the recovery period from my surgery, I thought of trying Yotel Singapore. Sadly it feel short of my expectations, there wasn’t tt friendliness one would come to expect of the fun Yotel brand. Rooms are poorly upkeep for a relatively young hotel. And cleanliness is horrid. Stains on mirrors. Hair in the sheets. Any hotelier knows that’s a big no-no! Would I go back again? Only if u are looking for an ample room, in a strategic location, on a smaller budget. If not,there are many other hotels ard the same area. ",30,Sep-21,Undisclosed,90,20

Staff could do a lot better,"The best thing going for this hotel is its central location in the heart of Orchard Road. Stayed here for 2 nights. Rooms (they call them cabins) are small but decent with modern amenities. However, the biggest disappointment is its staff. They appeared to lack warmth and friendliness. The front desk person I spoke with appeared annoyed when I asked to speak with his duty manager when he could not give me a satisfactory response to an issue encountered with the cabin. A waiter at the Komyuniti restaurant was downright rude in his tone and delivery in telling us we could not sit at a table adjoining that of our friend’s due to prevailing Covid restrictions. These 2 encounters in that short stay of ours did not speak well of the training these staff had received. ",30,Oct-21,Undisclosed,39,7

Value for money for the location,Real surprise - nicely tucked behind International Building and easily accessible to the rest of Orchard road. Facilities is basic but really adequate for a stay in Orchard -  interesting concept of 'Mission Control' for the lobby and each room is like a private airplane bunk (with recline-able  bed!) It was a good choice to have a washroom with full floor to ceiling view of the outside - great view of Scott Road and beyond. Otherwise space is limited though not a problem at all for a solo passenger. The next time round would love a room having a view of the Orchard Road side. Food choice seems limited though I do see quite a bit of people dapao-ing.  The two robots Yolanda and Yoshi are quite a novelty - will try to call for their service next time. Also a tip for massage…,40,Oct-21,Undisclosed,15,35

Average Experience,We went there for a family staycations but ended up with disappointments. Stuffs were not friendly & kid. Resources looks limited. Not willing to solve customers problems with an extra miles & try to find the fault to charge more. Every thing you will ask will get a robotic answer. May be due to they spend too much times with two robots out there. They should take care their guests properly & front officer should lassie with a manager to solve case by case rather than a robotic answer to all. Otherwise declare it as a budget hotel.

"Good service, uncomfy bed, bad sleep quality. Room extremely small!","I am not sure if the smart bed was supposed to be stuck halfway and not being able to go all the way down or straighten it - which caused me to have back pains after sleeping, thus resulting in really poor sleep quality.   Also, the lack of shower curtains made the stay really inconvenient as I was staying with a friend. Well if you're ok with seeing your friend's body then maybe not a problem for you.   The HDMI/USB port on the wall was also faulty and the engineer told us to connect the HDMI straight to the TV.  The room was already small, putting the laptop on the foldable chair makes walking around the room very very inconvenient.  On top of those listed, the request for amenities needed to wait for an hour because there were only 2 robots.  Supposed to be a staycay to rest,…",20,Sep-21,Undisclosed,3,2

Affordable Hotel in the Heart of Orchard Road,"This must be the most affordable out of all decent hotels in the Orchard Area. At slightly over SGD100 which includes breakfast, I certainly have no complaints. The pros were the location… in the  heart of Orchard Road, the cleanliness of the room and the decent breakfast which was part of the Low rate I paid. However, it was not perfect. The bed was far too soft and one of the most uncomfortable hotel beds I’ve slept on in Singapore. Also, due to its affordability, it is a hit among budget conscious staycationers. Expect to wait up to an hour for your check in if you have a Weekend stay like I did!

Uncomfortable bed and poor condition of air-con,The hotel room itself was fine and customer service at front desk was pleasant but what causes the poor rating was the condition of the bed as it was extremely uncomfortable as it was sinking down in the middle which make it hard to sleep.   The aircon in the room wasn’t strong hence it get very hot if we cover with blanket and will even wake up in the middle of the night because it’s was too warm to sleep even without the blanket which was extremely disappointing as next day we felt so restless due to lack of sleep.

Housekeeping: Bedsheets were dirty with stains and unknown little solid bits.  The view was slightly marred by the dirty windows (probably from outside)  Housekeeping was only done every 3 days and not daily because of COVID-19. Didn’t really see a logical reasoning behind this but oh well.   Lastly and most alarmingly, found a used pack of condoms on the floor.

YOTEL Staycation - August 2021,"It was a cool looking hotel within Orchard area. The price was quite affordable for a hotel that is located in Singapore's most popular shopping district. Its unique bed also has an elevating mechanism, unseen at other hotels. However, its building may prove challenging to find and its room was quite small to move around too.",30,Aug-21,Undisclosed,1,0

Cozy place with a great team,Mission control team were all very friendly so if you don’t like attitude here’s a great place to start! Be nice to the team though as they are all trying their best. Room was really small but cozy! Room can get quite dusty cuz of the lack of ventilation but you can easily request for housekeeping if needed. ROBOTS ARE CUTE; they bring your towels up for you!! TV was big and you can plug in your hdmi to your laptop. Overall I had a pretty pleasant stay,50,Jul-21,Undisclosed,3,0
10/10 experience at YOTEL,"The service was great at YOTEL. Even though, the room was small, it has everything you need for a great staycation. The room is super clean and the bed was really comfortable. YOTEL is aesthetically pleasing so you can take a lot of instagram-worthy pics. The swimming pool view is not that great though and there were lots of leaves in the pool. However it’s understandable since there were plants near the pool and it can’t be helped. YOTEL is situated near the malls hence, it’s very convenient to get food. OH AND YOSHI & YOLANDA are such cute robots!!!!

When I called for disposable cutleries to be sent to the room, the team that answered the call had a friendly tone and as someone who has terrible anxiety with making phone calls, I felt relaxed. I was greeted by the robots and it was a unique experience for me. My experience at the bar was also amazing with friendly service from the bartender and order taker . Cleanliness of room is also immaculate. All in all, a 10/10 from me :) Would definitely recommend YOTEL to my peers! Thank you for the pleasant stay! ",50,Aug-21,Undisclosed,1,0

Yotel Experience,I felt that Yotel Singapore's demographic is catered towards couples as the cabins are quite small and the doors of the shower is slightly visible. This would make it uncomfortable for those who are travelling with families. The pool is also not cleaned as there are lots of dry leaves in the pool and the room was quite dusty. ,30,Jul-21,Undisclosed,1,0

When I needed a lightning cable and HDMI cable for my ipad, the mission control staff were quick to help (though I must say I was fortunate enough to snag a lightning cable before they were all taken). When I asked to spend my $40 F&B voucher over multiple visits to the restaurant rather than all at once as required, the young man speaking over the line made sure that that could happen since I was staying alone and would find it hard to eat and drink $40 worth of food at one go.

Great for a solocation,Yotel had everything I needed for a short staycation. Location was great too as it was located within orchard and had direct access to International building. I highly recommend it for solo travellers or couples who just want to enjoy a short relaxing staycation but probably not for bigger groups as the rooms are small cabin-sized. I loved the adjustable bed and the softness was just heaven! Slept really well for both nights I was there and I was kind of reluctant to leave on the last day of my solocation.,50,May-21,Undisclosed,1,0

Staff were very accommodating to our requests and whatsapp one day earlier informing us that we could check-in early was such a nice surprise.  Robots were so cute. Kids absolutely loved climbing up and down the bunk bed and seeing the robots go on their missions. Neat view from the bathrooms as well. Breakfast was busy and food only so-so but good variety.

We decided to check out about 2am plus, as we were unable to continue using the Smartbed.  To be honest, a good and comfortable bed is the basic for a hotel. This Smartbed fails very poorly in this aspect.   The mattress sinks in on the edge and si­des, does not provide support, same thing for the pillows. The quilt material al­so makes it uncomfor­table to use.  This is something the hotel should review if it wishes to pr­ovide a good stay for the customers.

Good but not that Good,I feel that the room is pretty much acceptable for the price but don't expect too posh settings. Minimalist setting with all the necessary amenities that a traveller or short trip will need. The toilet is more spacious than the room in my opinion.,40,Feb-21,Undisclosed,1,0

Clean and comfortable stay in the heart of Orchard Road,"Room may be a little smaller than the usual hotel rooms, but makes it up in terms of innovative use of space and modern looks. Bed is comfy, though pillow is a bit too soft for my liking. Can be changed although I did not. Bathing facilities is awesome, and breakfast is filling and delicious, though all ala carte.

Short Staycation,"Took the First Class Queen and loved the balcony and the view! The check in was seamless despite being the public holiday period and the check in staff was really friendly and polite. However, the bed was too soft so did not really sleep very well and also, should consider having non smoking balconies so those who cannot take second hand smoke can have the option of choosing that. If not, if the next door cabin guests smoke at their balcony, it will cause discomfort to those who do mind the second hand smoke. ",30,Feb-21,Undisclosed,15,25

Poor cleanliness,The price of the hotel and the service of the staff were fine. The rest of the stuff such as the cleanliness of the room and facilities were bad. Given 2 rooms but both were dusty.

Upon arriving at the hotel, we were welcomed by a clean, quiet and sleek view of the lobby - self service kiosks on the left, robots on the right and service counters in front of us. The premium view bunk room is an experience, but slightly small for a 3 pax. Nonetheless, the high floor view on beside the bathroom/ toilet is certainly pleasing and satisfying.

The location is conveniently located just a stone's throw from Orchard MRT and the major shopping malls which line the area. I loved how simple the concept is. We felt safe throughout the check-in process. We loved the robots that delivered water to the room. It was my partner's birthday so it was a surprise when a robot delivered a birthday card for him. Absolutely would love to stay here again for a budget staycation in the Orchard area. Shop 'til you drop... into one of the rooms. Also, Komyuniti is a welcome surprise. Quiet ambiance.

Floor to ceiling bathroom windows,"With the floor to ceiling bathroom windows in their cabins, the shower experience at Yotel was probably the most memorable. Their cabins were very simple, functional and fulfil their brand promise of only focusing on providing the essentials. I slept well on their mattress. Though I have to say that service standards here are rather unremarkable. The purple lighting used around the property serves as quite a backdrop for the now necessary Instagram shot when on staycation. Check-in and out was quick and smooth without much hassle. Recommended if you are just looking for a self-sufficient, simple and value for money staycation experience in a time when leisure overseas travel is practically not possible.",30,Nov-20,Undisclosed,82,45

Reasonable price for a fantastic location,"For 3 guests, you couldn’t find a better hotel at this price for such a fantastic location. Right next door is the start of the shopping belt Orchard Road. However, bear in mind that the rooms are really small. The so-called room with a view is when you have to keep the toilet door opened then you are able to have a view. Once the toilet door is closed, it is really that’s it! A cabin! ",40,Jan-21,Undisclosed,25,42

Despite room size is small, everything in the room is neat and tidy.  Given a nice city view in the toilet but don't forget to bring down the bind before you do your business. Room door is thick thus i did not hear any noise from the hotel corridor. Nice smart bed that you can adjust the angle while watching TV on bed. Water pressure from shower head is good but the only issue i have is the glass toilet door.

Robocation,My kids loved Yoshi and Yolanda very much. Only thing is that Yolanda sings a goodbye tune but Yoshi just say good bye. Thus its better to get the female robot to deliver items to the room. It was raining in the 3 days we stayed there thus the water in the swimming pool was cold. But that did not stop the kids from going into the pool when the rain stopped for a while. Overall the kids enjoyed themselves. ,50,Jan-21,Undisclosed,1,0
review from Nyan desu,"Room was small upon first impression but the futuristic interior design was thought through, having smartbeds/tv to utilizing space very well (that a full-length ironing board could fit in without cramming the place). Full bottles of shampoo/conditioner etc were surprisingly provided instead of your typical small samples, and the toilet was so clean and cosy w a view of the cityscape and hot water (don't worry you can pull the blinds down for privacy when taking a dump).  YOSHI the robot was so cute and had a personality: It went, ""May the force be with you"" and ""Hasta La Vista, baby"". Didn't manage to meet YOLANDA though :( We had trouble trying to connect our device to the tv (it only streamed music and not videos??) so would be useful to have a thorough guide somewhere.…",40,Jan-21,Undisclosed,1,0

Decent,"I love the view, style and amenities of Yotel. Great location to access Orchard and train stations. When the hotel first opened the beds were in great condition, but recent visits shows the bed have sunken quite a bit. They missed out to replenish some amenities but were quick to recover after a call. As for their front liners, service seriously varies greatly from one another. The way they communicate COVID measures were not the most tactful. They have self-automated machines but at the end still require a staff to assist you or else end up diverting you to the counters, not a very smart check in after all.",30,Nov-20,Travelled as a couple,8,4
Noisy water pipes,"My husband and I booked a 3d2n stay to celebrate the New Year countdown to 2021. The room was very clean and I really liked the retractable bed.

However, I think the design of the room is very bad/not soundproof as I could hear water flushing down the pipe whenever the guests above uses the toilet/bathe. It happened in the day and we thought nothing of it. However, we didn’t realised how loud it was that we got awaken up at 3am by the water flowing through the pipes and it lasted about an hour!

Decent enough stay,"Comfortable as an overview review of the 3D2N stay in Yotel. Transport and convenience (to find food , shopping) is not a concern as everything is highly accessible. The premium queen room is relatively snug with not much space to sit down and have a meal in the room. The design of the room is slightly awkward as the window is in the bathroom. Hence , the blinds had to be wind up and down before and after usage of the bathroom. The sink is right next to the bed , might not be the best if you are not staying alone and your partner is a light sleeper. There is no proper table or space to be used to sit down and have a meal together in the room. Breakfast is average but still decent , with savoury and sweet options offered.

Special mention to Aaron at checkin, who noted the birthday of my partner and made a birthday greeting. Also, the birthday surprise and card sent up to the room was a very nice touch.

The first room we were allocated had random loud aircon noises, so we requested another room. This was handled quite efficiently and we were impressed with the professionalism of the staff involved. New room didn't have any issues. Note that the rooms here are very small though, modern and functional. Queen size bed. Good views. Rain shower but no bath. Small pool on level 10. Good sound insulation: no issues with neighbour noise. Decent value at this price level.",40,Oct-20,Undisclosed,41727,2866

Friendly and helpful staff,"Stayed at YOTEL Singapore for 3D2N with 3 other friends. The room was big and most importantly clean, I personally loved the huge mirrors all over and the shelf on the walls (we put random things like towels or keys there and it freed up more space in the room) Whenever we called reception to request an item, they always delivered quickly. Once when I was fiddling with the coffee machine, I spilt some coffee water on the floor and within 10mins a male staff was sent to our room to mop it up. Asked for another floor rug and he delivered really quickly too. Loved the speed and friendliness overall~  We tried the breakfast at KOMYUNITI but I wouldn't recommend it, mainly only served bread, pastries, sandwiches that didn't feel fresh.

Short Staycation,"Brought my family and my parents for a short staycation in this hotel. Reason I chose this hotel is because of its convenient location. There was a long queue during check in but I was cleared within 30mins.  Staff were friendly and warm and we felt welcomed. Our room was clean and I love the purple colour.  Our bathroom had a view of the Xmas lights 😊  However, the bed was too soft, I didn’t had a good night sleep though.  Overall, I would recommend this hotel and kudos to the management!",40,Dec-20,Undisclosed,56,28
An interesting experience in Yotel.,The management was flexible with the check-in timing. It was seamless and we did not have to wait for long to check in to our cabins. The location was excellent and the robots was an interesting experience. Even though the cabin was not big but its practical and had whatever we needed in a room. The cabin was clean and the view from the toilet was amazing!,50,Dec-20,Undisclosed,1,0

Comfortable & Clean,Tried Yotel once in New York 5 years back so we already knew what we gonna expect. Check in was at 3pm and the q took us around 45mins to complete the whole process. Cabin was clean and spotless. Pillows were too soft for us. Comfortable bed which can be adjusted if you want to lay back and watch tv. The tv was great with lots of channels and you are able to cast from your phone. Very cool! Toilet comes with a bidet which is a plus point. ,50,Nov-20,Travelled as a couple,74,24
Recommended :),"I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a short getaway. The room is relatively small but still provides everything you need to stay there comfortably.

Best decision to end 2020,"Although the room was small for 3 persons, it was a great price for our 3D2N staycay + breakfasts. It's very accessible from Orchard, the room was very clean, and we loved our stay. We brought a Nintendo Switch to play and connect to their big screen, and lots of board games. Would recommend! Only one downside is they seem understaffed, so both check in and check out, as well as breakfast queues can be quite long (i.e. about 30mins wait). Oh yes, and their were a bit too soft for our liking and our backs.",50,Dec-20,Undisclosed,1,0
Need more improvement in restaurants food quality and quantity.,"1) food portion was insufficient.  2) the roll only have 3 tiny slices of eggs. 3) the burger only one half slices of ham. 4) no ice.  5) no switch to off toilet light beside bed, have to stand up and walk over.",20,Dec-20,Undisclosed,1,0

Staycation VIP King Suite,"The VIP King Suite is nice, boasting 2 balconies that have awesome views over the Orchard Rd area. Has a king sized bed and a living room sofa bed and a dining table. The bathroom drainage had an issue though and the bathroom was constantly flooded.   Breakfast was not bad but the queue was very long. They should stagger the timings for breakfasts and perhaps inform me earlier that there was an option for takeaway or delivery to our rooms.   Overall, for the price, I guess it's good value for money considering the location and good views. ",40,Dec-20,Undisclosed,24,7
Cabin,", the room we took was a queen bed with bunk for 3 adults. The situation we encountered was the crampiness of the cabin. It's just that we didnt have much place to sit, I was surprised that there was no desk or chair.",30,Dec-20,Undisclosed,1,0
Innovative themed robotel,"As the picture speaks for itself, we were well greeted with a long queue upon arrival. The turnover of rooms does move pretty consistent, so do prepare to wait awhile or show up slightly early.  Fairly new hotel with well equipped amenities. The selling point will be most rooms start from high floor (L18 and above?) and with full window view. Room is small but fully equipped with basic amenities.  Couple of cons will be on the pool/gym booking were not clearly explained upon check in. Room does not seems to be sound proofed, from party rooms beside us. With all the ups and downs, I'm still pleased with this stay and is worth if you're considering a short stay.",40,Oct-20,Undisclosed,48,51

But other than that, location was awesome (right smack in the middle of orchard road with a lot of amenities and food places nearby, also very easy to travel to other parts of town. Just take the buses infront of the Thai embassy) .   Cabin was small but spacious. Love the full length windows in the toilet ( spent so much time in there just looking outside lol) . The windows also really helped to expand the space in the room. Sleep was comfortable and great! The only gripe I have was that housekeeping is done every 3 days.

My stay in First Class King ( Junior Suite) at futuristic hotel.,"It was my 2nd visit to Yotel. I went to lobby. People must queue to scan Safe Entry, then filled in questionaire and then temperature taking. Then people must queue up to check in.  During COV-19, no self-check in.  After few minutes waiting, I paid and was given a keycard . I then went to 30 th storey. I was impressed with First Class King. (got nice coffee machine and sofa, coffee table. even the worktable was large and chair was nice) . Very much better than my previous room - First Class Queen.

The check-in was relatively fast though we had to pay a $50 deposit which would be refunded upon check-out if you did not order food or drinks at their restaurant. The cabin (Yotel names their rooms ""cabins"") is small but compact with space-saving storage blended into the wall and furniture. The bathroom is surprisingly quite spacious with rain shower and fragrant shower gel and shampoo. The hand-sanitizer and wet wipes are a nice touch to the stay.

Nice location,Good location that can access to MRT and shopping area. Around the area you can experience close-by 24-hour food outlets. There is an option to request for firmer pillows but the bed is way too soft for me. Most likelt it is due to the bed feature itself.,30,Nov-20,Undisclosed,2,3

Unpleasant,"There was almost no service provided by the hotel. Even simple things like ice, you have to DYI at the Resturant. The staff are cold, unfriendly and not very helpful.

I thought that was plus point as he gave extra attention to details. As I read other comments from other trip advisor reviews, I saw that Yotel would prepare small birthday suprises but my gf never received one. It would’ve been a star above other 4 star hotel if they put in a little extra effort of service to suprise my gf for her birthday.

Great location with clean rooms,Booked a 1 night stay in this hotel and was extremely satisfied with the room and services.  I booked a room with a balcony included and was pleasantly surprised on how clean it is. Not that I expect it to be full of trash but I find it to be spotless. Some 5 star hotels can't even match this level of cleanliness.  The room was small but I can't complain because they advertised the size of the room through their website. I don't understand why some people can complain of rooms being so small when the dimensions are already being shown in the website.  One point to note is that their bed is not exactly comfortable. Younger folks may not notice but older couples may find it uncomfortable.  Breakfast was provided via takeaway as I believe their restaurant is undergoing renovation.…,50,Sep-20,Undisclosed,54,53

Staff throughout the hotel are quite friendly. However, they did not take into account of my specific order for breakfast.   Would go back again if these could be fixed, especially when these are easy fixes.",30,Sep-20,Undisclosed,2,4
Okay stay,"I might give this hotel another shot if they work on their checking in procedure. I arrived after 3pm and I was in line queuing till 4 plus. The line was long and there is only 4 person attending the lobby. One at the entrance. One is attending to self check in kiosk and 2 on the stations. Despite that, only 1 station is moving. Another station, whom I believed a korean staff manning it, took forever to check in. After checking in one guest she will take at least 5-10 mins doing her things and avoiding eye contact with us in line OR someone from the line has to approach her at the counter than she will attend to the guest. I will just give the benefit of the doubt that she is new. Fortunately for me, my room was ready on arrival and I am so grateful. Room was small but doable.…",30,Sep-20,Undisclosed,6,7
Location is great but not the room,"Stayed on 19sept to 20sept. Room type: first class queen.  Starting with the check-in process, due to COVID-19 there is a need for safe entry and such. This is something that I am not reviewing as back but good. So 1 star for it.  Location is great for local and tourists in future as town is just at your doorstep. So 1 star for it.  Staff in the hotel are friendly and helpful so another 1 star for it.  Here is the area that had lack. Normally I would put at least 2 stars into the room.  Room space is terrible. Once we open the door, my wife had to go in first and move to the right then I go in then we can close the door and proceed to the other part. Pretty unsafe to me.

Front Office staff were excellent - friendly and helpful Excellent Service - I asked for additional bottles of water, promptly received within minutes.  CONs:  More suitable for leisure traveler for a short stay of 1-2 days as the room size is too small. If you have lots of big luggages or have kids with you, unless you booked the bigger room, you're going to struggle. No writing desk in the room, business travellers be warned.

They call their rooms ""cabins"", and it is appropriately named as they are indeed on the small side but kudos to the designers for their smart thinking - storage spaces are smartly hidden in the walls and there are table spaces that can be pulled out (beside the bed) or folded down (in front of the TV).  That being said, this is not a hotel for you to spend the entire day in. This is a hotel perfect if you want to spend the entire day outside, take advantage of its location and go back to a comfortable and clean place to sleep.

There was a Long queue that formed all the way to the outside of the hotel.  Not high tech at all as it is advertised to be.   Every person that enters the hotel each time had to record their time in , room number and body temperature on a piece of paper with a pen that is shared which the hotel did not bother to change or clean.

I wasn’t informed that the gym and pool were reopened already (was advertised as closed previously due to covid-19 sgclean) so i did not prepare stuff to enjoy the facilities.  oddly this is a booking that did not remind me via email one day before my actual trip and i also had problem viewing my booking confirmation on my yotel account. had to write in to them to confirm.   if you really need to stay in orchard road then this works.,30,Aug-20,Undisclosed,5,15

The room was compact but they were able to make all the spaces functional. I liked the view from floor to ceiling window; however it is also on the bathroom side of the room and we had to pull down the blinds most of the time. But it was a unique experience. We loved yoshi and yolanda too. It was intriguing to see these robots going about the hotel.

Excellent property and staff but disappointing sleep,"The hotel is awesome. From the friendly staff at Mission Control to their restaurant and the novelty and convenience their 2 robots bring.

The pillow was way too soft for my wife and I while the mattress seems to have a dent on my side of the bed that made me have backaches on top of my neck and shoulder aches the pillows gave us.

Rooms are small, but modern and enough if you plan to explore the city and don’t want to hangout in the room all day. Toilet and shower are one with an incredible view over the city. Actually it’s a large shower with a toilet. The hotel is right on Orchard and therefore all shopping possibilities are around the corner. Everything else is good to reach - cabs are reasonable in Singapore. The cab to the airport was 20 SD. Also used the gym which is rather small and feels full with two people working out. Over all a good stay though. ",40,Feb-20,Undisclosed,32,38

Good Location But Room is Small,The staff at the front desk are polite. I was at the hotel in the morning around 9am and had to leave my lugguage with them.

He actually forgot to pass me the receipt.   Room is clean and quiet. But it is a little small. I had only 1 small carry on lugguage and a back pack. So it wasn’t too bad. If there were 2 guests in the room with 2 lugguages it would be cramp with little space for movement.

Excellent in every way,"I spent 6 nights here and could have stayed for many more. I was travelling solo, and had a double room but I paid extra for the view. Would highly recommended paying extra for the view, as it just added another element to enjoy. The room was compact but had everything I needed, and as a solo traveller I felt really safe. The location was extremely convenient, particularly in regards to how close the hotel is to Orchard mrt. The only thing I'd mention, while not an issue, was that the bed is made of something like memory foam, which tended to stay moulded in the shape of my body while sleeping - something that could be an issue if you are needing more back support.

Great modern hotel in central Singapore,"This is a great hotel if you want to be in the middle of the busiest shopping area of Singapore. My only complaint is the food facilities; breakfast is free if you book direct at their website and other third party websites had breakfast included in their rates. As a result, breakfast was always busy with too little seats and long queues at the egg station. But it doesn't matter because it's Singapore and a great breakfast can be had at any of the shopping centres for a cheap price so we just went out to have breakfast ourselves after the first two days.

Yes, it’s a bit quirky - rooms are “cabins” , staff are “crew”, but that’s no problem. The restaurant/ bar is on the 10th floor as is the exterior smoking area for those who want it. Our room was not so big , but with a queen bed that had a single bunk above it was big enough for 3 people. The bathroom facilities were also very good.

My husband used the gym and said it was small, only a couple of machines, but it was never busy.    The coolest thing about this hotel is the robots!

I was not offered anything additional and was not even offered an apology by the staff or management.

Quirky Concept,Space age concept. Very comfy bed and awesome views from the 30th floor. Not your average hotel room and as a mature couple not sure it was perfect for us.

Couldn't swing a cat,"I know they say so in the advert but geez the room is small. It's clean and functional as the brief describes however place two above average sized humans plus luggage into the mix and it becomes a jigsaw puzzle. The hotel is well located and check-in and out is seamless so the concept is great, just poor in practice.  Also, as the bed folds, it is soft and does not breathe and none from out group enjoyed a pleasant night's sleep, which is all we needed the room for.",30,Jan-20,Undisclosed,53,53
"Looks cool, however, after staying there, I would not recommend it.","The hotel itself is very cool. The robots were an unusual touch, and getting room service from there was a unique experience. The novelty does wear off after a while though. The location was great, the room was sparkling clean. However  there were a few things because of which I would not recommend it - the bed was too soft and too small (even though we are definitely average sized, or could even be considered small), the aircon was kind of confusing to reach an optimum level. All this affected the quality of our sleep. And moreover, the view for which there is a premium is from a bathroom which cannot stay open if you want to use it (public nudity is a punishable offence in Singapore and it is considered public nudity if you can be seen nude from a window).

Toilet with no jet washer?  ",40,Dec-19,Undisclosed,141,63

I was expecting a more capsule hotel like experience, where you are not really closed off from other guests, and you have more of a reclining lounger rather than a flat bed. I had an experience on a layover in Abu Dhabi in such a capsule hotel, it was nice to be able to partially lie down, but still it was not totally relaxing hehe. So that was what I was expecting.  This is a real room all to oneself, closed door, bathroom, shower, full flat COMFORTABLE bed for 2 people. It's not huge, so don't expect that.

Good choice of hotel in town with reasonable price,It is located in the heart of Orchard Road near Orchard MRT station. Next to it is Shaw House where there is a Lido cinema.

Clean hotel and good location but very small room,"As soon as we stepped in the room we felt like we were in a prison cell. Very small room. Our room was supposed to be with a view but the view we had wasn't like the photo. We stayed on 21st floor.  For some reason I could smell urine whenever our room was cleaned. I wonder that's because they cleaned the room with the cleaning equipment which was also used to clean the bathroom. However it appeared the housekeeping team did a good job. Mind you though, your bed sheet will be changed on the 4th day.  Overall it was a value for money hotel in Orchard road but I'll stay somewhere else next time mainly because it is too small sized room.  ",40,Dec-19,Undisclosed,1,2

Just walk out, we are at Shaw Centre. We can shopping, eat and drink. While we also can reach mrt Station with 5min underground walk. Also all the shopping mall in Orchard, we can access them easily. 1more thing to add up, the view from toilet are stunning. We can have city view from toilet with big window.

Also the information on the back of the hotel room door was not the same as on the intercom. We also were waiting for the floor marshals as indicated on the information on the back of the room door.

My only complain is that the room is rather too small in comparision to other hotels that i have stayed in. Other than that this hotel is perfect.",40,Oct-19,Undisclosed,17,11

"Minuscule in size, but mightily impressive.","If room size is not a major concern, you'd want to check out (and check in at) Yotel.

"Great location, comfortable and clean room","Can't say how pleased we were with our stay at YOTEL Singapore. Really clean and comfortable room with stunning floor to ceiling view of the city outside. We were facing Orchard Road and it was cool to see the bustle of one of Singapore's busiest streets. The robots are also a unique feature that we haven't experienced before.   Location is great as you're right on Orchard Road for shopping and restaurants. It's also less than a minutes walk to the closest MRT (Orchard) through the Ion Mall.   We stayed for 10 nights and the hotel provided free drinks at their Komyuniti bar on our tenth night as a thank you for staying with them which was a nice touch. Everyone we dealt with for check in/out, recommendations and booking taxi's was very friendly and helpful.",50,Nov-19,Undisclosed,34,46

Great novel Hotel Experience,Checked in late for one night on way through. Had read about brand and was curious.  Room is very small but very well designed and appointed. Has all amenities and appointments. Bed super comfy and with automated inclining is great for sitting up. Linen throughout great. Pillow choice. Shower ample big enough with great soaps and view or windos for exhibition. Gold. Breakfast was also very good with ample choices. Location is so central with an elevator ride off to side of lobby to Orchid Rd. Prrfect and will return many times and explore more properties in the chain. Thank you.,50,Nov-19,Undisclosed,152,110

Average Stay,Following our recent stay at Yotel Singapore I can say the experience was very average. Pros of the hotel are that you get the room made up everyday and bottles of water also. Given the hotel is relatively inexpensive it is nice to see these basics taken care of. The negatives of the hotel are the rooms struggling to get cold the aircon has a lowest temperature of 21c and cannot be turned lower. The staff also could have been more helpful at times rather than the stand off approach they decided to take on the occasions they were needed. Overall the hotel is in a good location and if you are looking purely for a bed for the night it would suffice otherwise there are nicer hotels in the area within the same budget ,30,Nov-19,Undisclosed,19,43
good price and great location,"good location on orchard rd and near to MRT station and shops.

Horrible experince but great location!!!,An absolutely horrible experience. We had fully paid for a room for five nights which they gave away to someone else as we were late to check in. The pushed us into a room category that was not what we had paid for and they did this without informing us. When I took it up with them all they did was make excuses and told lies that they had informed us.  All in all a horrible expericence. Would not wish it on my worst enemy.,10,Nov-19,Undisclosed,61,50
Fantastic Place to Stay,"We stayed 4 days here. Check in was quick and this was at 10:30am. They had a room ready. The rooms are very unique, we had a small room with a bunk bed, small but very serviceable. They have robots that take care of room service. The breakfast was very good. The restaurant is on the 10 floor. Yotel is a quarter block off Orchard Road, with a very big mall 5 min walk from the hotel.with lots of cafe, restaurant and coffee shop in are around the area.The hop-on hop-off stop is 2 min walk in either direction, Cannot say enough good thing about the staff or this hotel. If you need a car are taxi to the A/P, Universal studios or around Singapore just ask the staff at the front desk they can get you the best deal in transport.

Safety Isssue,"I had an incidence where there was oil based paint in the elevator at 6pm. I got it all over my hand and was unable it wash it off.

Lack of Privacy + Small rooms,rooms too small and Didn't feel private. Felt like i had to be hyper aware everytime i opened the front door cos the first thing people walking by see is your bed.

Good location and hotel but small ,"Location is the best aspect of this hotel as it’s located in a central location where it is easy to access the metro.  The hotel is very clean and staff are helpful. However, the rooms are very small! The design is modern and quirky with a bed that moves and storage is cleverly designed however there is very little storage and once you have your luggage open there is very little space!  Breakfast has a fairly good variety and everything you need, option to sit outside for breakfast is nice.  Rooftop pool is nice but it is quite small. ",40,Nov-19,Undisclosed,18,22

Quirky but fun,I’ve never stayed in a hotel where a robot has cooked breakfast or brought bottles of water to my room until now.

Cool hotel but...,"Has robots as your housekeeping service if you request for towels or water bottles, but when they’re busy, it’ll be ‘human‘ housekeeping staff. Although ‘one of the housekeeping staff was pretty unfriendly and rude (when we requested for water bottles, she threw them on our bed and made a face). Good space in the room but narrow walking spaces so big suitcases not advisable. Shower and bed was nice ",30,Nov-19,Undisclosed,1,2

Good and bad at the same time,"YOTEL is a lovely place with all its technology, the kids are very excited to see YOSHI and YOLANDA in action, they were extremely surprised when YOSHI sent a bottle of water to our room. Additionally, the location of the hotel was perfect, convenient, accessible and innovative.   However, the room was too small for the family, had to squeeze a little. And unfortunately, there was no room service provided by the hotel, we had to go and get our own food. It would be better if food could be sent to our room.",30,Oct-19,Undisclosed,2,2
Perfect place for solo or couple,"I love this place! Great location and very helpful and attentive staff. The room’s a bit small but it has all the basic needs.

Nice Cabin Concept,"The location without no doubt is the best. We always thought that Orchard was way too expensive, but the price are reasonable. Althought the cabin concept make the room smaller, but we love it. We're 3 adult women, stay for 3 days, at first we thought that this room was small. But actually it has everything we need ! The furniture was minimalist, compact but the bed and the bunk are really good and comfy. Despite the small size, shower room are big, with a blurry glass wall.  If you stay with the kids, they will love the 2 helper robots. Too bad we didn't got the chance to try them The breakfast also great, located at the 10th floor, you can see pool area from here.",50,Jul-19,Undisclosed,68,45
Compact but complete,"Yes, the rooms are small, BUT they have everything you need!  Kettle, tea/coffee (creamer instead of milk though - not so nice for us tea drinkers), USB charging ports, water, and a very comfortable bed with a nice tilt option.  The roomy shower (with a view if you're daring!) makes up for the tight quarters in the room.  Fine for one person but will be cramped with two for more than a night.  Adequate breakfast buffet - nothing to rave about but the options were reasonable and complementary which was appreciated.  Very friendly reception staff.  I'd definitely stay here again.  12noon checkout much appreciated - and I was offered 1pm which really suited me as I was heading out at 12.30pm. Quiet.  Great night's sleep!

If there is a thing about this hotel is the service on brealfast time. Need to wait for 15-20 minutes to refill the bacon. But in those minutes i can enjoy something else.",50,Oct-19,Undisclosed,1,2

Friendly staff and clean hotel,"I had a nice stay in Yotel Singapore. Their staff were friendly and efficient, including the robots Yolanda and Yoshi. I like that they use big bottles for their shampoo, conditioner and hand/body wash in order to minimize trash. The room where I stayed in was quite small but it was clean and basically had everything I needed for a 1-week stay. However, it would be better if they could provide bidet hosts in their toilet since not all people can get by just by using toilet paper.  Moreover, they could add some more food selection in their restaurant (Komyuniti).",40,Oct-19,Undisclosed,1,2

Good hotel & location,"I booked a room through Agoda and the price was about 120$/ per night.  The location was excellent, right at Orchard Road central, nearby many malls, good restaurant, food courts, bars and MRT stations.  There a bus stop right there at their entrance, and it connects to many routes through the city so it was very convenient. I was easily reach to the airport, Garden By The Bay, the port,... A plus point for sure. And this hotel is also close to some MRT stations.  The room is quite small but new built, clean and neat. There a restaurant However, there was only one thing I would be unpleased is the air vents are suck. If you eat smelling food in your room, or you just use the toilet, the bad smell gonna stay long in your room.  Overall, I would recommend this hotel since it made…",40,Aug-19,Undisclosed,4,9

"Fun, futuristic, friendly","Fun - who wouldn't love a hotel with movie + TV theme music in the lifts, robots that call out ""Wingardium leviosa"" as they enter the lift to deliver water and towels to guests Futuristic - don't expect big rooms, but everything you need is in the super-compact 'cabins' , and importantly the beds and pillows are super-comfortable, we slept brilliantly. Futuristic too because of the awesome skyline view over Singapore, shower while sticky-beaking across the island :) Friendly - the staff are really great, and went out of their way to help when asked for assistance - a big plus to making our stay memorable, enjoyable and likely to return.

Great location,"Great location!  Rooms were way too small ! Husband and I could barely maneuver around in the room when either of us had our luggage bags open. Thank goodness we were only there for 1 night. Showers were great, but I didn’t like the fact the toilet was also in there as well. 😑 If you are a smoker you will need to go outside and across the street to smoke. ",30,Oct-19,Undisclosed,1,2

Great hotel,For the price and the location this hotel cannot be beat. We were able to take the train from the airport for $2.60 each. The MTR station is at the ION mall diagonal across the street. The staff is very helpful. The rooms are small but very efficient. The bed is comfortable and we didn’t hear any outside noise on the 11th floor. A robot will bring you extra towels and waters. Very cool. The hotel is located in the heart of Orchard. We took a taxi back to the airport for $26. Can’t wait to stay here again. ,50,Oct-19,Undisclosed,2296,835

Great value for money,"This is an excellent property located in the prime Orchard road area in Singapore. Stayed here for 3 days and found it perfect for my requirements.  The orchard MRT is a five minutes walking distance away, literally in the Ion Orchard mall. Take the underpass at the Shaw house.  Breakfast spread is decent but make sure you finish your breakfast by 10.30 AM, as opposed to starting your breakfast at 10.25  AM as I did only to find out one day that the staff will clear away at 10.30 regardless of when you entered.

"A well organized hotel room, in a strategic position","The hotel is located in the heart of Orchard road, very close to Orchard subway station (line 1- red) and it is in a strategic position. The hotel is well organized considering the size of room. We went there with 2 kids and they loved to sleep in the second bed on the top of first one.  The common area is a little small, but being in Singapore the priority is to visit the city, not stay just in hotel. Additionally the hotel is very close to bus n.123 which can send you directly to Sentosa (beach station) in 40 minutes.  ",40,Oct-19,Undisclosed,78,29
