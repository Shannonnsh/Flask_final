Alexander's Adventures ,"We we were put in the tiniest room, had to climb over eachother to get to the bathroom, so very helpful when asked for twin beds, and w e got to stay until 6 for checkout, thanks Matthew. Close to shops, food outlets and markets. Probably best suit younger people.",30,Oct-22,Travelled as a couple,53,53
Functional and Efficient!,Very good location with two MRT stations within walking distance. Good working desk. I already knew that the room size was on the small size so this wasn't an issue. Prob could have done with more power charging points (only 2 in one room).,50,Aug-22,Undisclosed,14,0
Good place to stay,"Clean place, good location, very good experience. They have a good price cafe and bar downstairs. Staffs here are friendly and repect guests. Check in is effective and we checked in earlier. Good place to try.",50,Oct-22,Undisclosed,1,0
Very nice,Staff are very attentive and the whole place is super clean and comfortable. Only issue was the storage space was very hard for a 2 week stay with 2 people amd had to get creative to have a liveable space.,40,Oct-22,Travelled as a couple,18,25
"Helpfull staff, good location","Good location, excelent breakfast. The staff were very helpfull. Aisha on reception even took the trouble to help us find the train station and advise us on where to visit on our two day break. The room was small but clean and had all the facilities we required.",40,Sep-22,Travelled as a couple,1,0

"Singapore is expensive, the Hotel G is probably as good as it gets at the budget end of the market.","Good location, very close to Bugis, 15 minute walk to Little India, 200 metres to the MRT entrance on Bencoolen St. The check in staff are very helpful.  Interesting decor, I'd call it funky industrial. The rooms (numbers 11 and up on each floor) are unusually long and skinny, maybe 8 metres long and 2 metres wide but after an initial WTF you find it works quite well. Avoid rooms 01, a very small and cramped double, and rooms 02 an even smaller and more cramped single. Everything is very clean, the shower is hot, the bed is good. There are no fridges but an ice bucket is available from the bar downstairs.",40,Aug-22,Undisclosed,2,0
Would recommend,"So far so good! Nana did a great job of checking us early and getting us a room after a long flight!!! It is a very clean and modern hotel in a good part of town. Would recommend this for solo and couple travellers, maybe a bit small for families depending on the room",50,Sep-22,Travelled as a couple,371,173
Good Location!,Good location! Walking distance to Bugis and Plaza Singapura. Full of local hawker centre and restaurants around the area. Good for foodies to hunt the local food. Rooms were small but clean and front desk staff wasn't friendly. Overall its one of the best location that I have stayed in Singapore hotels. Rooms for improvement! ,30,Sep-22,Travelled as a couple,1,0
"Great Hotel, Service and near from Bugis and also MRT","- Hotel was great - The staff is very polite, and helpful and clearly explained about the details. - Very clean - Room interior very nice - Breakfast great! - Was staying for 3 night, and very near from business district - Would come back for sure!",50,Sep-22,Travelled on business,14,2
"Comfy, great location and clean.","We had an excellent 6d. stay at Hotel G. Some people complain about the small room size but hey, you are in Singapore! Everything is tidy & clean with an outstanding service by the front desk staff - especially Matthew! Very convenient location with good restaurants around the corner: from tasty paratas, 24/7 great Thai food and great 25 Degrees hamburgers to a succulent steak am√©ricain at Ginett. Discount for hotel guests at Ginett and 25 Degrees.",40,Aug-22,Undisclosed,19,0
"Comfortable, clean rooms","We really enjoyed staying in Hotel G. Room was small but comfy and clean. We had a view to Marina Bay Hotel üëç. Wifi worked great. Good location, metro nearby. Full respect and thanks to Matthew who was very helpful and supportive, early check-in was allowed by him. Recommended!",50,Sep-22,Travelled as a couple,5,0
ginett,"dined at ginett with my family for a birthday celebration. ambience and atmosphere was nice and warm. The staff working there was amazing, elevated our dining experience with their attention for details.",50,Sep-22,Travelled with family,37,38
Dissapointing alternative to hotel.,"Is bit hipster/rundown backpackers hostel asking money on level of real hotel. Rooms are interestingly decorated, but very very small. Management is not really trustwothy. Our group left hotel early after first night and booked in much better and convenient IBIS nearby.",20,Aug-22,Travelled on business,2,0
First time in Singapore,"Tristan at reception was a nice guy, room was small with a large bed but with a good view out of the window, everything was clean and tidy. Good location, planty of shopping and dinning places around.",50,Sep-22,Travelled as a couple,304,101
Pleasant Stay in a Convenient Location,"I checked in a night after my business partner came and it was tremendously smooth and easy despite arriving at past 1am.   The corrodors were a bit tight but enough for a full-sized hotel trolley to pass. Room is budget-sized, we booked 2 single beds. Toilet is just right for budget travellers, no bidet, but quality of fixtures and toiletries is above average with the rainshower option.   Location is very convenient: - a block away from Bencoleen MRT Stn - a few blocks from Bugis shopping malls and the market  - popular bar downstairs - neighnorhood food stalls nearby  Breakfast option is the bomb! You can get East Asian and contemporary options with quality espresso too!  The Duty Managers are divine with their personalized attention to us especially with several oversized‚Ä¶",40,Aug-22,Travelled on business,1,0
"Great Location, Great Breakfast, Great Stay","My friend and I really enjoyed our stay at Hotel G. We found the location to be very central and only a short walk from unique neighborhoods, restaurants, bars, and shopping malls. We were also able to easily walk to Marina Bay Sands and the Gardens by the Bay. And it is close to three or four metro stops (on different lines) making public transport really easy. The room is very sensibly laid out, with cute touches, a comfy bed, and a waterfall shower. Breakfast is also fantastic; with a wide range of choices (local, international, and ‚Äòwestern‚Äô - the lentil dal is especially amazing). The staff is also great - especially Matthew at the front desk, who made us feel very welcome at check in.",50,Sep-22,Travelled with friends,2,2
Wouldn‚Äôt choose this hotel again,Rooms were very small and not what I expected. Shower and toilet share the same space (literally you could showers while using the toilet). I have stayed in a number of other properties in Singapore in a similar price range and this was my least favorite. I also am not as fond of the neighborhood.,20,Sep-22,Travelled as a couple,1,0
Hotel G Stay was great!,"Our receptionist Matthew was awesome! He was very helpful and kind. We checked in our bags in our bags and checked in to our rooms early. They were kind enough to help us out even though check in was 2 hours from then. Room was nice, clean and affordable! Will definitely stay here again when I come back!",50,Sep-22,Travelled with friends,2,0
Excellent service,"so far it has been quite a pleasant stay. staff have been exceptionally accommodating to my requests. special thanks to kalai and ziwei for agreeing to bring a cake up to my room as a surprise! i really appreciate it, and will definitely be back :)) i highly recommend this hotel.",50,Sep-22,Travelled as a couple,1,0
Breakfast not recommended,"The location is nice! Breakfast is not recommended! I regretted to eat breakfast in the hotel!  If can, better eat at toast box near by. The hotel not very sound proof. The hotel plays music at the hallway but I can hear it in the room. Very annoying if you want to sleep off late.",40,Jul-22,Travelled as a couple,4,0
"Clean and Convenience, small hotel with everything you need.","The hotel is in nice area, close to MRT station. Reception staff, Matthew is very friendly and helpful. Good service. Room is small but have everything you need, clean and chic decor. Best match for those who looking for nice place to stay but spend a lot of time explore the city.",50,Aug-22,Travelled on business,53,5
4-star hotel?,"Although the hotel is offered as a 4* it is not true. The rooms are very small and mine specifically, was a double one and one roomate has, at its side, the wall. Teo middle bags cannot be opened at the same time inside the room. The sink is outside the bathroom and the wc and the shower are together, with no separation so when you shower, the floor and the wc get wet.   The breakfast (in level 1) is ok, but if you go 15 minutes before closing, they start removing the food.   The reception is located on the 2nd floor.",20,Aug-22,Travelled as a couple,230,78
"Not Perfect, But Decent Nonetheless","Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights for a work trip. Room was on the small side, but very clean, comfortable, sleek, functional and well-designed to maximise the limited space. Common areas were in general a bit tight, including the car access area to the lobby on Level 2 (bigger cars might have difficulties coming up for pickup/drop-off). Staff service was excellent - friendly, helpful and welcoming. Breakfast provided was basic but of decent quality, and hotel guests are entitled to a discount at a connecting restaurant called 25 Degrees Burgers. Above all, the hotel is centrally located within close proximity to eateries and amenities, and only a short walk to Bencoolen MRT and Bugis area - really good location. Probably not good for families, more for work/solo trips. Overall‚Ä¶",40,Jul-22,Travelled on business,4,0
Not a place to return too,"It felt like we had arrived at a youth hostel, although the man at the desk was very pleasant, he had no knowledge of the area or tourist attraction. The room was a queen omg! It was tiny! No room to open the case nowhere to hang clothes, the shower when used soaked the whole room. Clothes felt damp. Unless you are a young backpacker or don‚Äôt mind roughing it give this hotel a wide birth. The only plus we‚Äôre good location and breakfast.",20,Jul-22,Travelled with friends,6,14
Very good place to stay,The reception staff superb especially Yvonne has been very very helpful with all my questions and requests for assistance. I will be coming here next time I am Singapore. Good service /good facilities and good value for money. regards Ian,50,Jul-22,Travelled on business,10,0
nice cozy room,wish the space to king size bed in all direction was better.  no concierge service i.e. you carry your own luggage!  no pool - that was expected.  staff was courteous and was very responsive. Breakfast was as expected.,40,Jul-22,Undisclosed,8,0
"Decent Hotel, but not worth the money",Excellent location. Very small rooms and not worth for the money. WiFi also an issue. Facilities were limited. Not even a place to hang your clothes. I had a Great King room and hence the desk for working was good. Wash basin outlet pipe was also clogging.,30,Jul-22,Travelled on business,3,0
Boutique hotel with professional front desk staff,"Very good training staff, fast and efficient. The atmosphere of the hotel is very chic. They do not have a decent lobby to access. If u have a suitcase to carry. U need to be aware the entrance. The front desk is in the second floor. It is better to access by taxi if u carry a big suitcase like me. Other than that very decent hotel",50,Jul-22,Travelled solo,2,0
Very Senior Friendly,"18-20 Jul 2022-someone in the family was tested positive, to protect our 2 elderlies, we had to house them in a hotel.. turned out Hotel G was an excellent choice! Reception staff Ms Nana offered us a room fitted w senior friendly amenities - seat in shower area, grab bars in the toilet, low bed for easie movement, spacious room to accommodate wheelchair. Ms Natalie was so kind to fulfil our requests to get meals to their room on time and even get vegetarian meals for 1 of them who‚Äôs vegetarian. Mr Matthew was ever so friendly greeting us w smiles behind his mask each time we approached the counter. The housekeeping staff were excellent very prompt in cleaning up the room.

Amazing stay and staff!,"We stayed at Hotel G Singapore for a couple of nights and everything was excellent!! The Manager Daryl was super nice and providing us with an excellent service at all times!

Quality Service!,My second visit to this hotel. Darryl was very welcoming and provided tip top hospitality to me and my friends. He handled to our requests and needs very attentively and tried his best to accord - was given a room upgrade & also welcome drinks voucher from Ginett! Reservation Haziqah also provided seamless and easy booking! Kudos to the team @ Hotel G!,50,Jul-22,Travelled with friends,1,0
stayed 10 nights having everyday same breakfast.,"room is very basic. for long stay the cleaner doesnot clean the room properly. glass, mugs and floors are dirty even after room service. the complementary stuffs in the room were not top up regularly. for short stay or one night stay probably good option. Breakfast has no varities having everyday same menu. location wise good as it is close to bugis and bencoolen MRT.",30,Jul-22,Undisclosed,27,34
Three Night Couples Stay,"This hotel is perfect if you want to explore the city for most of the day and you are not spending much time in your accomodation. It is clean & modern. There is a very nice bar with reasonable wine prices at the ground floor and it also has a burger restaurant which also seemed reasonably priced. Bencoolen MRT Station is a short walk and connects with all the main MRT stations including Bayfront. The breakfast was buffet style and was perfect every morning.  Only faults were the size of the room, which made it very difficult to even open a big suitcase and also the lifts are very slow.  Overall ideal for city explorers looking for somewhere to rest their heads at night. ",40,Jul-22,Travelled as a couple,3,4
This place is like chocolate coated dog crap....looks good but really isnt.,"This hotel is cute but tiny. I would never stay here again. The service is very average, beds are ok but the room is very very small. 2.5 meters by 2.5 meters in the sleeping area. I wanted to leave as I had other places to go but was told I will not get a refund this was not advised in advance. Beware this place is like chocolate coated dog crap.... Looks great on the outside but has a nasty surprise when you look inside. I hope they go broke for being jerks.",10,Jul-22,Travelled with family,1,0

Honeymoon trip,"We booked 3 nights at Hotel G (a 4 star hotel) room type queen bed when we were back in Cairo but when we arrived and the receptionist ( her name is Hema) knew that we were on our honeymoon trip, she upgraded our room type to king bedroom. She was amazing and super friendly, helped us with a lot of attractions booking. Hotel is at a central location next to a lot of 24/7 open restaurants and supermarkets so we had an amazing experience trying out lots of cuisines (turkish, thai, indian, vietnamese, chinese) and there is like a bar (couple of bars) corner which is open till late (3 am).  The room is a bit small though but everything is clean and super cozy. You can also use their restaurant which is pretty good and affordable even if you didnt book any food in advance.",40,Jun-22,Travelled as a couple,117,42
Friends Staycation,"Did a staycation with my friend on their Linger Longer promo which is a two-night stay in their Good Room. It was bundled with 25 Degrees‚Äô (the restaurant downstairs) It Takes Two box which includes 2 Signature Burgers and 1 side.   Room + Amenities: The room was comfy enough for two petite ladies like us! Interesting layout where the sink was outside the  toilet. They use fancy METIS brand soaps which smell good! There's no wardrobe in this room though so you'll have to hang your clothes by the mirror at the entrance where there's only 4 hangers.  Food: Only comment for the burger combo we had that was included in our promo package was that the fries tasted a little stale. Otherwise, the burgers themselves were pretty decent!  Service: Staff were super friendly and accommodated‚Ä¶",40,Jun-22,Undisclosed,4,2
Fantastic location,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights from the 15th June, the hotel is in a good location with loads of shops, restaurants and markets nearby. We ate in both restaurants located under the hotel as if you are a guest you can have a discount, food really good in both. Our room was spotless we were on the 6th floor in 0632, the room itself is very small but we knew that before we arrived so wasnt much of a shock, we did joke that the pictures made the room look huge, all basics in the room and really comfy bed with quilted mattress protector which always makes a difference, they have a green policy so wont clean the room the day after you arrive unless you request it which i think is quite a good idea, overall really good experience and would definately stay here again",50,Jun-22,Travelled as a couple,1,0
Cosy stay,"Consider for the price (please look out for their promotion packages from their own website), location and service, overall staying at Hotel G make us feel comfortable and relax. Daryl Goh who serve us, also impress us with his excellent pride service which he initial to upgrade our queen size bedroom to 2 single beds without any charge, explaining that it is much more convenience for my mum to walk about during the night which is true and really thoughtful of him. He also did an early check in for us and explaining everything in detail. It did make our stay more enjoyable. We definitely will be back üòä",50,Jun-22,Travelled with family,32,3
second time... there will not be a third for sure!,"This was our 2ns time at this hotel. We brought friends along as being quite reasonable prices and location is great. We thought that after 2 years closed because of COVID the hotel.should be spotless clean, but no. It is worst than last time we came. Shower has mold, rust spots and dust everywhere. The curtain blinds id the room were full of dust, we opened them and a cloud of dust flew.over our heads. As we came with friends and we had in total 3 rooms we dis also check.whith them, same story in the bathroom and the room.  But most important and to underline is that when you check in they inform they wont clean the room daily unless you stay 3 consecutive nights!!! it was a definitely ""no"" for us all.

There was no shower curtain in the toilet.",40,Jun-22,Travelled with friends,21,14
Dysfunctional establishment geared to facilitate the management not the customer!,This is a dysfunctional  establishment which appears to be run to facilitate the the management  not the customer! Different facilities like Ginett and 25¬∞ are open at different times on different days. You also have to book well in advance for Ginett (during my 6 night stay I was unable to secure a table in the restaurant). The various parts of the ‚Äòhotel‚Äô are dysfunctional with each other as I was unable to book the restaurant at reception for Tuesday when Ginett was closed on a Monday! I have numerous other examples but since I suspect the management would not be interested I will not waste my time,20,Jun-22,Travelled solo,1,0
"Great accomodation, amazing service!","Been to Hotel G many times before, always loved how unique and homely the rooms felt. Our recent stay was a step above, partly due to the amazing service by Daryl the hotel manager. He made sure all our needs were met and made the check in process as seamless as possible (didn't even take more than 2 minutes to get our keys). Was pleasantly surprised when he offered to upgrade us to a bigger and better room and extended our check out timing. Would definitely come here again!

Good hotel for the price,Have stayed many times when visiting Singapore. Very inventive services - I always feel like they think of everything. The staff are also very friendly and helpful even when I asked about some quite complex situations. Only thing that isn't great is you have to walk through a trendy restaurant to get to the entrance so it can be kind of awkward. Otherwise great place.,50,Jun-22,Travelled on business,6,4
Disappointed Stay,"We spent 4 nights at our hotel and experience isn‚Äôt up to our expectations: Pros: - Nice design  - Good location Cons: - No fridge as we couldn‚Äôt thought at 4 star hotel - Poor breakfast selection. You are only choose one main course, which is the most terrible and worth to choose to stay at others hotel including buffet breakfast. The hotel management should public explicitly about this option for guest to consider to book at this hotel rather than mention ‚ÄùBreakfast Included‚Äù - Service is just ok. Staff isn‚Äôt friendly and accommodating.",20,May-22,Travelled as a couple,27,0
Nice stay in Singapore,"We've stayed for 2 nights and it was a nice stay. It was a small room but enough facility. Hope the price was cheaper.

Disappointing,"The rug in the hallway looks like it had its day, and the smell adds to that feeling.  The gym is advertised to be open 24/7 but it's not. You have to get an appointment from the receptionist and he (Mr. Luke) insisted it is not open before 6am. No room for negotiation. Basta.   For a 4 Star hotel one would expect a bottle of water in the room, or a shaving set, or maybe both. But neither is available.   Had to go to the reception 3 times until they finally managed to get my card key working.  Yeah, nah, this hotel is a let down.",20,Jun-22,Travelled solo,1,0

2nd staycation and it was even better,"It was my 2nd stay at the hotel as the 1st was great. Hotel is conveniently located within walking distance between the various MRTs line. Apart from the convenient location, hawker centre and shopping malls are nearby and there are a few tourist attractions within walking distance too. Reception services at the front desk are great and hassle free, I was able to check-in fuss free. Booked the Great King Room and in my opinion and it was great. The room had all basic amenities needed for a short stay and it is spacious enough for 2 person. Breakfast served at Ginette was great and lunching there was great due to its affordable pricing (within $10-$20/pax).

Bad- initially I stayed at Good room for one night, then upgraded to Great Room that is slightly bigger. Still find the rooms very small and not sound proof.   I am very disappointed that the hotel provided expired Body lotion to guests. Realised it when I got back home as I took it home since I used it halfway. I have attached the photos.

Great customer service and chic room.,"I would like to highly commend Mr. Daryl who helped us check in before the check-in time due to our flight arriving earlier than expected. The check-in process was quick and professional. Our room package includes free burgers and room decorations which Mr. Daryl informed right from check-in. He also gave us a bottle of red wine, I'm not sure if that's part of the package or it was complimentary by him but we highly appreciated it.  Our room was a King size bed, the room is compact. Just enough to open a large-size luggage but will need to close it back up to have any walking space. The room is fully equipped with all the amenities you can want.

I feel the pillow is quite flatten but it could be better. The plus point is if the toilet has bidet. Other than that, all is good.   Place is good for solo staycay to have a proper me-time.

Staycation booked using a Singapore Rediscovers voucher,"Normally I would not book hotels through Klook but I did so to utilise the Singapore Rediscover voucher.   The hotel is actually quite small but it has a hipster theme. (Reminds me of the Papa Wale hotel in Taipei)  For the price I paid, its value for money for Singapore standards. Nice and clean but its a tiny room. If you pay slightly more, you can opt for M Social on Klook and get a bigger room.   Pros: Nice and clean but really no facilities in the hotel. Eateries near hotel and Bugis is a 5 min walk. The service staff was prompt in her emails, etc. Excellent service overall...  Cons. The sink in the room is tiny, the pillows need to be thicker, the carpark entrance confusing. ",40,Dec-20,Travelled with family,4,0

Great Hotel,Good Vibes at this hotel with cool room design and a trendy lobby. Front desk staffs looked cool with their jeans. But their level of service is tip top.

Overall Good Experience,"Pro:  They allowed me to check in early which was a blessing. The room size was efficient & follows a minamilist style.  The room was well air conditioned (bonus!) Great location, I felt very safe.  Con: The sheets made me itch throughout the night.  There were random hairs found on my bedding & when I looked through the snack box, there were hairs along the bottom (gross).  Breakfast was an extra surcharge and honestly not with it. The halls were humid and had a moldy smell to it! The walls were paper thin, heard noises all hours of the night.    Overall the cons are just suggestions to improve the overall quality of guests stays. Housekeeping just needs more attention to detail.",40,Jun-19,Travelled solo,1,0
staffs are kindly,"The location of the hotel is very convenient to the various attractions. Although the room is small, it is not easy to open the luggage, but it is acceptable. There are a lot of rooms, soundproof quality and good sleep quality every day. Although the breakfast style is not much, it is enough to eat enough. The hotel staff are very friendly and courteous and patient. Overall it is a very nice hotel.

My view of Hotel G,"Overall it was an wonderful experience during the staying. If I got say something for the improvement, I think it would be the shower, the door curtain is unable to prevent the water spilling to the outside, as a result the floor is wet and slip",40,Jun-19,Travelled on business,2,3
Great holiday experience starts with a great first impression of the hotel,"Almost everything about my stay at Hotel G was perfect.  The only thing is the matter of housekeeping and toiletry / towel provision.  On the first and second day of stay, I was not provided with a tube of shower gel, which I thought was probably not provided to start with.  However a tube a provided on the third day.  The same with floor towel, it was replaced on the third and fourth day, so I had to resort to using the bath towel to wipe the floor dry instead.  Apart from this, every aspect of my stay was perfect.. I loved the compact and modern design of the rooms  The location was great and it was easy access to anywhere I wanted to go to.",50,Jun-19,Travelled solo,1,2
Excellent,"Great service, nice room, great location. Liked the fact that the housekeeping crew was happy to provide me with more shower gel at my request. Only thing I felt could be improved upon was the soundproofing of the room. ",50,Jun-19,Travelled solo,119,65
Firm but fair ,"Rooms are tiny (matchbox size) yet they have everything one needs. Beds are wall to wall yet they have desks with a chair. Prices are firm, but Hotel G makes it work with a central location and hip aesthetic. Nice restaurants downstairs with a variety of price options. My wife and I walked from Hotel G to both Orchard Rd and MBS so access is fine throughout the CBD.",40,Jun-19,Travelled as a couple,1,2
Stopover,"Room was very small although second visit on return was better with a king bed. Very clean. Also on our return we went to the hotels breakfast only to find new managers had cut costs and changed the menu while also putting the price up significantly. Hot food included scrambled eggs and baked beans but No bacon!! You can't have eggs without bacon! Not only that, they took all the food away while paying customers were still eating! The machine coffee was undrinkable. For the price you should at least get a handmade coffee!  ",30,Jun-19,Travelled as a couple,8,11
A convenient place with an affordable price,"It is near to the Bencoolen MRT, Rocher MRT and Bugis MRT station. Only a few minutes walk. It is 10 minutes away from shopping malls. It is a comfortable place to stay but you don't expect it will be luxurious and spacious. One little minor thing is that they have no lift at the front door. (but there is one at the back door.)",40,May-19,Travelled as a couple,1,4
Nice,The room is so small but the staff are very nice and willing to help I lost my wallet and they found it and not single cents was taken but the rooms are so small but it was a nice stay but next time I have to take a better room the room was to cramp and the shower water could get into your room please make a better romm for a single person stay,50,Jun-19,Travelled solo,82,38
Compact but well appointed ,"I stayed there for a couple of nights on my way to Europe. The hotel is really well located. Close to the Bugis metro (though it is still a 10‚Äô walk- not ideal with heavy luggage)from where you can hop on the metro to about anywhere in Singapore very easily. The area around the hotel has everything: markets, temples, shops, restaurants and is in walking distance from town centre.  The room I stayed in was compact, but very well organised. It did not feel cramped. There was a big window with a nice view over the city, a compact but pleasant bathroom.   Registration at 2pm is a bit late I find. I am still on the lookout for hotels with more flexible registration hours.",40,Jun-19,Travelled solo,7,12
Clean and in good location,Everything was good and I especially liked that there was a French Restaurant at the street level entrance to the Hotel. Rooms were compact but cozy with interesting decor. the only downside was lack of a fridge in the room. Upsides included an in room safe that was big enough to sore a good sized laptop computer.,40,Jun-19,Travelled on business,1,0
staff experience is terrible,"during my stay, staffs has been entering my room without any permission. this is rude and disrespect. I have informed the counter regards of my hours extension yet they keep calling up asking for details. I supposed they should have my details during my check in..so I not sure why are they keep disturbing my sleep.  ",20,Jun-19,Travelled as a couple,1,0
Good value for money despite some issues,"Got frustrated about check-in part, early check in at morning, was advised to come back after2pm and when I came back 4pm, room still not available, no definite time for when able to get room nor other solution. Many people and kids stuck at a crowded reception. I was upset by how hotel coped with the situation on the day although finally got sorted around 530pm.  After 3n stay, good location, reasonable price, tidy room. Breakfast includes various options, western and asian, fresh, simple and nice. In the end, hotel offer an airport transfer as apology and I really appreciate.  Will definitely recommend it for good value for money",40,Jun-19,Travelled as a couple,2,2

"good hotel, near downtown.","Location wise is great. Breakfast is just acceptable, not up to my taste yet, but coffee is good. Hard to access to the lobby and lift especially if you are partly immobility or immobility. You need to take a staircase passing through the bar to reach the lift",40,Jun-19,Travelled as a couple,2,2
Weekend getaway,"Really cosy room :) However, I can‚Äôt seem switch off the dressing area lights without taking the room card out, and when I do so, the room became a little stuffy.  Other than that, I really like the location of the hotel. ",40,May-19,Travelled as a couple,1,0
Cool design,"Great location, clean, trendy design of the rooms. I especially liked the mobile provided in the room, which you can take with you and use internet (google, maps) outside of the accommodation to explore the city. Only thing I didn't like is the shower together with the toilet, so the space would be flooding with water after the shower and it would take long time to dry.",40,May-19,Travelled solo,306,159

I'd only wished there was more selection and variety in the breakfast spread, but it's still pretty decent and standard. A big plus for the hotel is the location. It's close to many different bus stations and MRT stations that can take you conveniently to most places.

Not advisable for Senior travellers who sleep in the inner side of the bed, not much space to walk when getting up to toilet in the middle of the night.

small somewhat impractical room but good location,"stayed in the midsize room for a couple of nights. the room wasn't large by any standard, but that didn't bother me traveling solo with light luggage. what bothered me was the arrangement with the toilet/bathroom area. there's no door between the toilet seat and the room, neither is there anything except a flimsy curtain between the toilet and the shower. the whole room was steamy after taking a shower. near mirror / sink, there is hardly any table area to lay things on. i understand small rooms are sometimes necessary especially given the price, but these are not exactly well designed to make use of the space. noise insulation wasn't stellar, woke up several times to people coming home from nightlife. location was good: bugis, orchard road, tekka centre, etc, within walking‚Ä¶",30,May-19,Travelled on business,50,26
Stylish and charming hotel with modest space,"This hotel is very well located and has charming, stylish decor. I stayed alone and it was great for my trip, as I was meeting friends staying nearby.

Short Staycation,"Having a squeaky clean room with no disgusting stains or smell have always been our top must-have criteria in any hotel we chose. We are glad that despite some claims on the net about Hotel G, our stay turns out to be pleasant and better that what we anticipated. Hotel is clean, staff is well dressed, professional and friendly. Though the room is rather small, the room is really clean (quite high-tech too) and the theme just make you feel at home and cosy. Mattress is comfortable with clean bedsheet. Not to mention, the toilet - the toilet roll is nicely folded in neat shapes with Hotel G sticker and shower curtain are not at all moldy and stink (in fact it looks brand new).

Nice stay,"Check in was relatively quick though there were guests waiting in a limited reception area which is on the second floor. So, you may need to carry your luggages up the stairs a bit if you don't come by a car that can drop you off directly on the 2nd floor through car park.

There is a safe under the bed and also a little cove under the bed for your suitcases- we could fit two under there fine! Yes the lifts are slow but one was down for maintenance and we never had to wait that long. Check in and check out were quick and we were able to store our bags on the day of departure.

On the downside, I've found only details: the breakfast buffet is okay but not amazing with a lack of details. As an example, I sometimes struggled to find basic things such as a small spoon, salt and sugar as it was not on the table every day I went to. Also, I had dinner there and I had to ask thrice to pay for the bill. Exhausting where you're tired and you just want to go to bed.

Good shower, decent amenities, good lighting & some clever design to maximise space. There was lift maintenance on one of three lifts while we were there resulting in a LOT of waiting around, partly because the cleaners have enormous trolleys that fill the lift.

Nice but small,Great little hotel in a good location.  Clean and modern room however it's just too small for a couple.  It's an ideal room for the solo traveler but there's simply not enough room throughout the room for more than one person.  The breakfast was quite good with an adequate selection and variety.  There's also a downstairs bar/cafe if you feel like an afternoon or evening drink. Would definitely recommend this hotel if you are traveling alone. ,40,Apr-19,Travelled as a couple,1,0

I asked the room service lady on my second day during this stay, and she remembers mypreference, and ever since then, every time I see her in the morning and afternoon, she would ask if I have everything I need in my room and if I need extra shower gel.

Why could the hotel not pay extra to have maintenance done at night when far fewer guests would need to use the lifts?  Also to have housekeeping using the lifts during the day further complicates the situation.  Not managed very efficiently at all.   Breakfast is just horrible.

Be prepared for up to a ten minute wait. The hotel lifts are the same as totally inadequate elevators installed at the Cloud Forest tower over at Gardens by the Bay., so there must have been some back-room dealing by the normally incredibly together Singaporeans to let themselves down by completely under-specifying lifts. If you have multiple devices that need charging via GPOs, the room is under-wired.

There are no bedside tables to put your glasses or water.  There is no light if you want to read in bed.  There is an overhead hanging light but the on/off switch is across the room.

Tiny space terrific staff,"The room was extraordinarily small, much smaller the the picture displayed.  The shower was adequate without proper pitch so the entire floor got wet.  There was so little counter space that a brush or toothbrush would fall on the floor when placed next to the sink.  There is a bonus stoop to perch on in the corner near the platform bed.   The bed is difficult to maneuver around as one needs to jump over your partner to access the toilet.  Very little space is available to walk. Since we stored a suitcase in the hall leading to the door we had to negotiate our way around it to access the door.  What this placed lacked in room space it made up for in service and adjacent restaurants.  Very nice breakfast each day in Ginett and lunch at 25 degrees restaurant was very good.

Swiss army room,The hotel is a great place to rest your weary travelling head. What it lacks in size makes up for the room amenities.

One evening the internet failed. The staff were incredible in their response, the manager even offering me his computer! The issue was fixed fast with a temporary work around in place. I don't think you can offer more than that!  Yeah, I know what you're thinking... this is a fake review. NO it is genuine, for a genuinely good place. We will definitely be back.

Highly Recommended - will stay again!,"I spent my last few days in Singapore by myself and Hotel G was perfectly located close to Bugis; I was very close to the shopping district and MRT station. It was easy to travel to Orchard, Tiong Bahru and Raffles (to name a few places) to meet friends and family. One of my favourite aspects was getting a quick breakfast at Toast Box or Ya Kun Kaya Toast near by before exploring the rest of the day. My room was spotless, had great air conditioning and I loved how comfy the bed is! I was unsure what to expect for the solo room as photos can be deceiving, however it exceeded my expectation.

Poor room layout,"Although Hotel G is in a nice area of Singapore near to many places of interest and reasonably priced, the rooms are small and poorly laid out.  We arrived early in the morning and ""upgraded"" for an extra $20/night.  I hate to think what our originally booked room would be like.  There was no closet and no place to put the luggage other than on the floor which made the room even more cramped. The worst of it however was that the bed is on a platform about 15 inches off the floor with virtually no clearance at the end of the bed. This is really awkward in terms of getting out of bed to go to the bathroom during the night as it is almost impossible not to disturb the other person in the bed.  Not recommended for older people especially with limited mobility.  The room was clean‚Ä¶",30,Jan-19,Travelled as a couple,2,0
Very slow elevator,We were there for 1 week. One of the 3 elevators was under maintainence for the whole time.  So everytime to go out in rush hours is a 10 min wait to go up or go down.

Elevators take WAY too long, 1 elevator was out of service but I was there for 4 days and it was not fixed, so this might be the case ongoing, it do not seem to be getting service. Lobby was packed, especially during checkout making it a slow process. Entry and exit from the building was inconvenient as you need to enter/exit through the restaurant.

When you enter the restaurant for breakfast, you will say morning, then ask the room number. It is a warm welcome to treat you as a hotel guest.

Breakfast buffet was average, and the wait staff didn't seem like they wanted to be there.

Good for solo traveller,"Booked a Good single room which was perfect for the solo traveller. The room was tiny as expected, but had everything I needed. The bed was very comfy.

The vanity kit and shower cap which i had used was also not restocked. ",40,Dec-18,Travelled solo,1,0
