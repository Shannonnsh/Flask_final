Enjoying Singapore ,"Excellent property and a very convenient  location.  The hotel is close to many shopping centres and attraction sites and it is a  3 minute walk to the train station ( MRT )  . The front desk staff are extremely efficient, pleasant and helpful. The property is clean and has a fantastic  charm.The room  is spacious,   clean,  very comfortable and  equipped with all the amenities that a traveller might need. Also , the room has plenty of drawers to store your stuff.  Despite the fact that this hotel is located in the heart of the city , the rooms are very quiet and have a calming vibe every time i enter the room . Expect a free, fast-speed  internet and a TV that you can connect to your device. I just love this place and I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family .  ",50,Oct-22,Travelled as a couple,33,10,Carlton
A great holiday at the Carlton - Singapore,"We just came back from a wonderful week in Singapore, where we stayed at the Carlton. It was the first time we stay at the hotel and were pleasantly surprised! We couldn;t have asked for a better location, it's in the center with a close proximity to 2 MRT stations, surrounded by shops, walking distance to museums, and great places to dine. I was specially impressed by how friendly the staff is! The concierge Mr Ali was extremely helpful and always greeted us with a smile, gave us a map, explained where everything is and suggested places to dine in and visit. The hotel is very clean, sanitisers are located everywhere, the rooms are extremely spacious and toiletries are provided individually wrapped. We're definitely going to stay at the Carlton in our next visit to Singapore!",50,Jun-22,Undisclosed,5,2,Carlton
Gone down hill in a big way.,"I’m staying at the Carlton for 12 nights. 2 more long nights left. Always speak highly of it and it’s my preferred SG hotel as it’s so convenient. Not this time. It’s been an unpleasant long stay. Stained floors where it looks like a murder has taken place which is disgusting. Moisture stained/damaged roof, moisture dripping down all over the wall. No hot water in the shower morning or night regardless of the time. Room generally smells like a damp musty dungeon. Everything in the room feels moist and sticky. Wi-Fi that intermittently works. Room service that was cold and missing the key component of the meal. Pool area and bar that shuts at 7pm. I can appreciate that it was Grand Prix week but this a 5 star hotel at $300 a night in what is supposed to be the “premier wing”. If the basics aren’t done right it’s completely unforgivable. The rooms need just as much attention as the nice looking lobby. Wish I could get some of my $4,000 back. Hostel would have been a better option at least I could have gotten a hot shower.…",20,Oct-22,Travelled solo,33,10,Carlton
Excellent hotel,"Excellent. Dad and 2 teenage sons stayed 5 nights for the F1 GP.  Requested rooms to be close by and twin beds in one room.  Ended up getting adjoining rooms which was fantastic.  Rooms spacious, clean and comfortable.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Made good use of the Gym and pool.  Breakfast was excellent. Good location and easy to get around from there.  Will definitely stay here when next in Singapore.",50,Oct-22,Travelled with family,18,41,Carlton
Business,"Clean hotel, but check-in was an issue. When we finally got into our room 12.30 am. We tried to make a call to get a drink or milk, no one answered the phones for over 20 minutes. Staff was very friendly but the breakfast was a little plain. Neet to get a better coffee bean for the machine.",20,Sep-22,Undisclosed,48,27,Carlton
Great location,"A convenient, friendly hotel.  Not elaborate but nice rooms.  The same goes for the morning buffet.  The staff was very kind.  There were a lot of flight crews checking in and out, so getting service at the reception desk could take a bit of time.",40,Sep-22,Travelled on business,18,14,Carlton
Exceptional Receptionist,"I often come to Singapore as I work for an airline. Carlton hotel offers always a premium service. Their staff even in the busiest moments are always friendly and professional and they try anything possible to please their customers. I would like to highlight how exceptional is Azlina, a reception agent.  She always goes above and beyond finding a solution and displaying incredible professionalism, empathy and love for her job. Thank you",50,Sep-22,Travelled on business,8,2,Carlton
Pricey hotel in a central location,"Located near Chijmes the Carlton is an excellent hotel for business travellers and for vacation. Some of the corner rooms are great, but can be noisy (live music). Infrastructure and food leave little to be desired. Staff are friendly and courteous.",40,Aug-22,Travelled on business,47,50,Carlton
Great location and large rooms,"Stayed one night at this hotel prior to flying to Thailand. Great location next to Raffles hotel and Raffles shopping centre. Staff are lovely and attentive, rooms quite large in size. Wifi is a bit patchy from the rooms but otherwise happy with the cleanliness of the room. Would stay again",40,Sep-22,Travelled with friends,1689,194,Carlton
Terrible Cleanliness,"I stayed here once before and had an enjoyable stay. However, this time I booked a room for my sister and her family but the room was so terrible. The drainage was clogged. I took a shower just only 5 minutes then the floor in toilet bowl area was all wet and bath tile edge seal was mold. Disappointed.",10,Sep-22,Undisclosed,5,0,Carlton
Loved our stay here. Gorgeous room and great location and breakfast,Can't fault this hotel. Was a little worried about some of the reviews and also knowing this is an older hotel but was pleasantly surprised to find it's been renovated and everything about it from our experience was great!  Positives: - Amazing view! - Great location! - Large buffet breakfast with heaps of options.  Negatives. - Like all of Singapores 5 star hotels it's pricey but on the lower end I think?  Would definitely recommend to stay here and book a room with included breakfast.,50,Sep-22,Undisclosed,104,97,Carlton
"Nice hotel, some confusion about payment","The hotel is very nice and in.a convenient location in central Singapore.  The breakfast buffet is good, but some variety would have been good for a multinight stay.  Internet was stable.  I had some problems with my advance payment, but this was taken care of.  Pool area is nice, but closes early.",40,Aug-22,Travelled on business,43,52,Carlton
Very average experience,"I recently stayed at the Carlton Hotel for 5 nights for a business trip and it was a bit of a mixed bag. Whilst the hotel and room is quite nice my main issue was with the staff who in my opinion failed to deliver.   During check in, the staff did not greet me nor did they crack a smile during the whole process. When I asked about the breakfast timings I was basically cut off and told that this would be explained to me when he was done. Not a great start to my stay.   Even worse was the check out as I had asked for a late check-out the day before and the lady confirmed that I could leave at 3PM. The next day my room key did not work when I came back from a meeting at around 1PM and when I approached the reception I was very rudely told (by Yogesh I think his name was) that I…",30,Aug-22,Travelled on business,157,211,Carlton
Great location,We stayed here for five nights and it was a great choice. The hotel is perfectly located to discover the city.We had a room at the 14 th floor (prime room) and we had a wonderful city view. Breakfast was very good ( if they could add pancakes every day it would be great!!) The pool was the only thing that we didn’t like but this is totally personal All in all we had a great stay and would go back again,50,Jul-22,Undisclosed,45,52,Carlton
bad service and housekeeping,"sustained a deep cut due to a sharp edge on the weighing machine in my room toilet. called for room service to address the matter and get first aid. manager and staff did not apologise at all. NO follow ups were made after as well.  instead, the manager took away the weighing machine and claim he will do further investigation. what investigation may i ask? to do DNA test on the sharp edge and check if i was lying? i was already bleeding profusely and my blood wasn’t stopping.  some amenities were dirty and chapped, unless ur trying to get ur kids injured and receive unprofessional services after, do not recommend especially if you have kids.   during my stay after the accident, a decent follow up and apology would have been appreciated. however, NOTHING was done.",10,Aug-22,Travelled as a couple,1,0,Carlton
Location location location,"An agency booked the hotel for me and I didn’t expect anything other than just a business hotel.  On arrival I realized I can cross the street to have my first Singapore Sling at the Raffles Hotel, and only one block away from the wedding scene church location  in Crazy Rich Asians. Food courts and restaurants surround the Carlton, so I didn’t get to experience food much inside Carlton other than the included breakfast. Too bad breakfast starts at 7 am and for a few days I wish it could have started at 6 or 6:30 am when I had to be picked up early. The Carlton is highly centrally located, clean, modern, and the staff is exceedingly polite and friendly. Though there are fancier hotels in Singapore, like the W, Mandarin Oriental, and the legendary MBS (all at 2 or 3 times the…",50,Jul-22,Travelled on business,2,4,Carlton

Good but not great,"Rooms are large and clean and in-house foods are yummy especially ""Seafood Hor fun"". The location was amazing as well, being right next to City Hall MRT, and walking distance from multiple malls. Wifi had good connectivity.  Disliked · breakfast choices, there were not many choices and they were always the same, for s$40 breakfast not worth. The reception staff needs to be polite and welcoming and not show a straight face. the bed was not comfy. I stayed with my wife and 4 years old toddler it was not king size, not a large queen was some in-between. and as we requested a way ahead two double beds and it was in a different floor so they could have changed all 3 rooms but they were not so helpful. though the overall stay was okay but not great. So next time I will prefer to stay…",30,Jul-22,Undisclosed,73,59,Carlton

Elegant Hotel,"I am a regular customer to Carlton hotel Singapore, they always maintain the high standard but my recent stay has showed they had dropped a bit in the cleanliness standard. The bottom of the shower glass door and bathroom seals in my room were very moldy, the cleaner need to use bleach to clean them.  My other complaint as  usual as other customers were the breakfast choices, there were not many choices and they were always the same, fried noodle everyday, after staying the third days my family and I had decided to skip the prepaid breakfast.    the last but not the least, the reception staff needs to be polite and welcoming not showing a straight face.",40,Jul-22,Undisclosed,17,35,Carlton
3 star hotel room with 5 star hotel price..,The room is like a 2 or 3 star hotel…it’s very dark inside with no view at all. The water temperature is very unstable. Sometimes it’s very cold and sometimes it’s very hot. There are ants in the room. Definitely not recommending this hotel as it is not cheap at all. We have changed to another hotel in Singapore with a lower price but what we get is much better. The only good thing about Carlton is that there’s screen mirroring in the tv so that you can watch Netflix and YouTube there.,10,Jul-22,Travelled as a couple,2,0,Carlton
Executive room facing buildings…,"I booked a night stay for executive room, I booked via Traveloka and the price states that Executive rooms are more expensive than Premier room so I was expecting a room with a nice MbS as seen on the website. Upon check-in, I was surprised that our room’s view was buildings and buildings. I was so disappointed as I booked the room for birthday celebration and checked with the reception who told me the better room is Premier room. This happened to be long weekend and they insisted that premier rooms are full.  In room dining service and room service requesting for extra blankets and pillows were good and fast! Location is very good as it’s just opposite Raffles City shopping centre but I will not visit again to stay in a room facing buildings. Pool is very small and can forget…",20,Jul-22,Travelled with family,99,59,Carlton

Ok hotel but missed the details,"Stayed for three nights at the start of my honeymoon. Hotel was fine in the whole, good location and very clean with COVID precautions. Although they were aware of our honeymoon, they never acknowledged it at all ☹️ There was a water leak on the carpet which we informed the staff about, but they never responded with a reason or change of room. As a westerner, it felt like the staff were only interested in their Asian clientele. I would choose a different hotel next time I visit.",30,Jun-22,Travelled as a couple,3,0,Carlton
Fantastic hotel in a great location,"Fantastic location and close to Raffles City shops, food court and the MRT. Rooms are clean, modern and well maintained. Housekeeping were happy to provide extra towels and ice. Great staff at the Carlton all very friendly and happy to assist us.  What was outstanding for us was on our first day at the hotel we took a taxi to Makan Sutra Gluttons Bay for dinner I left my wallet behind in the taxi. All I could remember was the driver was Indian, I didn't know the taxi company or noticed his name. I took a chance by ringing the Carlton concierge and explained about my lost wallet.

two night layover,"As a member of Accor, IHG, Marroit & Hilton, this was not my choice. But travelling with my parents and they have stayed here numerous times and wished to do so again. For them close to church, MTR and Raffles City plaza. Check in and out is smooth despite a lot of other people doing the same. A lot of airlines including BA use this hotel.  Dont get stung by the buffet price like we did. We wanted someting quick and decided to try the hotel buffet. We were not told upon entering that it was a special seafood night and the cost $118 per person not the usual $35 per head. After a long flight, busy day and being with my parents, we definately needed a drink. NO BAR. It is a good hotel, but unlike my parents, not what I prefer in accomodation",30,Jun-22,Undisclosed,27,47,Carlton
Good location. Ask for newer rooms.,"Great location. Walking distance to Bugis Junction and plenty of options for food nearby at CHIJMES. Good service & helpful staff. I think my room is newer as I also go to my friend's room on the other wing and it's a bit outdated. So I recommend to ask for newer room.

Standard hotel with convenience location in the city center,"Highlights are convenience location near city hall, Raffles shopping area, some walks to Suntec ,Bugis and MRT Raffles city.

Not Recommended,"We stayed here for 4 nights during the Eid holiday. On a positive notes, room was clean and spacious, Housekeeping was quick abd efficient, the location is fantastic for tourists. However, the service at the Front Desk was incredibly rude and I failed to express with words how upset I was upon check in. I left a feedback on the first night itself, only to be contacted by the Duty Manager on my 3rd day staying. He called to extend his apologies but then no action or service recovery was rendered. I saw other guests who checked in received such fabulous service with politeness, I wonder why it was not extended to me during check in?",10,May-22,Travelled as a couple,146,54,Carlton

City Staycation,"It was a nice staycation at Carlton hotel as the crowd was not as packed compared to the peak season. Checking in and out was a breeze with minimal waiting time. Hotel guests were mostly tourists and business travellers. The room was spacious, clean and toiletries were sufficient. Walking distance to shopping malls and various restaurants was a stone’s throw away. Buffet breakfast was great with a variety of choices. Parking facilities is situated at the hotel lobby with much convenience.",50,Apr-22,Travelled as a couple,46,16,Carlton
Unpleasant check-in makes an unpleasant staycay,"Front desk experience set the staycay mood.  Check-in experience was unpleasant. Staff received me without a smile (can tell from the eyes under the mask). Requested for a higher floor room and was assigned to 11th floor. Power slot in that room was faulty. Went back down to same staff. No apologies rendered for the inconvenience. Was then assigned to another room in Level 12. So apparently, there were rooms available in higher floors but staff didn’t do her best to assign it to me in the 1st instance.   Rooms have a strong musty smell.  Bathroom is more impressive than the main area in premier room. Volume in bathroom is spolit. Toiletries were in-house brand n shower gel is lumpy.

Checking in was a breeze and Adrian made me feel very welcome with his top-notch service.   5 stars for the room. I booked the Premier room which comes with a bathtub and a rain shower. Cleanliness was at its best, extremely well-maintained and nicely renovated with trendy marble look-alike bathroom wall tiles.

I emailed them multiple times to request a change of dates but they did not have the courtesy to even respond leaving me in a complete limbo. i still dont know if i still have a room or will get my money back if i dont have the room.    As a business traveller, i find this attitude totally disgusting.",10,Mar-22,Travelled on business,1,0,Carlton
Long hour of waiting to check in.,"I arrive early at 12ish to check in early or to avoid queue. The staff got me to register and told me that they will call me if they have a room. Not only he didn’t call, we have to re queue for an hour to get our keys. I a prowl of 3 hours, no one bother to honour the promise to call me when there’s room. We came back on time and queue. Carlton literally took one hour away from paid time. We are supposed to check in at 3pm, and at 4pm we are still queuing. Standing for an hour. This is not the first time you have handled crowd.who is going to compensated the one hour of waiting, standing and the promise of call back. Very disappointing to be ignore like that. Bad experience started even before the hotel stay. Horrendous!",10,Mar-22,Travelled with family,4,2,Carlton
great staycay with friends,"Great place to staycay with friends. They didnt have connecting rooms but they gave us rooms side by side, the room was really big and spacious, there was a seating by the window, a sofa chair, a desk, chair plus extra space to put luggage. One bad thing was the air conditioning wasnt that cold so we had to set it pretty low but after that it was ok. Check in was really smooth! will definitely stay here again",50,Mar-22,Travelled with friends,153,79,Carlton
Ideal location.,"The hotel is strategically located. I stayed at the Premier Room which overlooked Raffles Hotel’s swimming pool. The room was spacious and clean but the decor may be a little dated. Also, the room setting is rather dark. It seems to be poorly lit. Breakfast at The Mosaic was alright. To conclude, nothing really bad but nothing exceptional either",30,Oct-21,Undisclosed,31,15,Carlton

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"Nice hotel well fitted out and comfortable rooms. Great location for shopping and access to other parts of the city via bus, taxi or MTR. Staff were exceptionally friendly and courteous. Nothing was too much to do and they were always smiling and ready with a greeting. Great coffee shop, Tuxedo and restaurant Wah Lok. Breakfast was good more of a fixed set menu's but under covid conditions much better than I expected. Again staff excellent.

"Good, could have been better",Stayed 3D2N here. Good to have smoking rooms especially since i am a smoker. Hotel was clean and the right size. My only problem was there were no dressing rooms at the swimming pool vicinity. My pool time was also disturbed by some youths who were monkeying around in the main pool with their ball game and splashing water everywhere. Would have helped if hotel staff keeps an eye once in a while.,30,Jan-22,Travelled with family,65,10,Carlton
Good place for a solo staycation,"stayed at the carlton hotel for a night over the past weekend at room 1380. the place is great for those who are staying solo. room is cosy and comfortable enough. the only downsides of my stay are that some of the gym equipment were not available for usage and that the bathtub was a bit narrow for me to lie down.  nevertheless, am thankful and appreciative that i got upgraded from a deluxe to a premier room. thanks to dian for checking me in and the gym staffs on shift on 18th dec afternoon and 19th dec morning for facilitating my use of the gym (apologies as i didn't get your names). breakfast was alright and express check-in was seamless.",40,Dec-21,Undisclosed,4,0,Carlton
First Staycation,I had my very first staycation at Carlton hotel last year during Christmas holidays. Me and my husband stayed at premier room (room no: 1582) with pool view. Our room was at the end corridor which overlooked Bras Basah. Chek-in time was staggered so we got to early check in at 12pm which was very good as we heard all hotel check -in start after 2pm. The room was very spacious with king bed and the best part of room was their marbles bathroom with big bathtub.

Booked on a b&b basis and breakfast was taken at the Mosaic restaurant.  Although a limited menu of about 5 sets service was good and staff very friendly. I was even taught how to use chopsticks - which is not my normal choice of cutlery.

Am being generous with the 2 stars,"Positives: - Room was clean albeit tired-looking - Bathroom is beautiful. Not sure if they renovated it recently  - Big sized bathtub - Early check-in  Negatives: - Service is the worst I’ve experienced in any Singapore hotel.  - Right from the start at check-in we knew we were gonna be continuously disappointed. We had the quietest check-in with Adrian who didn’t even greet us or ask us for our ICs. We just stood there staring at him with zero conversation or personalisation. He did not even go through the reg card with us just simply asked us to sign at the bottom. Didn’t tell us what room we booked for, how many nights or any safety measures. Hello, Covid???

SHN stay was poorly managed by Carlton hotel,"I am currently serving my SHN at Carlton hotel with my husband and unfortunately the experience has been really bad for us.

Lunch again was served for one and we had to call back for the second.  There were multiple days when breakfast and lunch were delayed. We also requested for the menu at least 5 times since Day 2 and each time told they will 'inform the food team' to send to us, but eventually we only got the menu shared on Day 11.

Check in was a breeze and we got a room facing Bras Basah.. so was glad the reception staff are very helpful to help us change a room and got us a Suntec City view instead.

There were no contingency plans and staff were not well trained to deal with the issues presented. No one was on site to assist the poor staff and to assist him. He had to manually check if the rooms were ready. When asked if there were alternative arrangements, staff were unsure. When we reached our room, the TV was not working.

"Big, comfortable, soulless ","Visited during a quiet period due to the virus impact on tourism and it makes it difficult to assess what this property would be like during normal operations. Everything was smooth and efficient but almost inevitable for such a large hotel it lacks any real character and is best treated as just a place to rest ones head overnight.  The room, basic “deluxe” was perfectly adequate and met the key requirements for a city centre hotel in that it was well soundproofed with a comfy bed, excellent shower and good blackout curtains.  The pool is unusual in having a good deep end and is better for swimming than as a general lounging around area.

On our last morning we left our suitcases to be looked after as we were not flying until the evening. One of our cases was a little damaged but still alright to use. We left to walk around the city and do last minute shopping. We decided to buy a replacement suitcase for our sickly one and we would ask the hotel to dispose of the old.

Right in opposite of famous Chijmes hall with several dining places, it is also nice to get a tasty bite there, before going to bed (a bit pricey, though). The room did not meet my expectations to 100% as it felt a bit too „business hotel like“ and not really individual, although everything was clean and in order.

Great location,We stayed here for 3 nights over new year.

The rooms themselves are quite large and clean although I did have a tear on the bottom sheet that I noticed as soon as I pulled the covers off the first night...not sure how someone doesn’t notice this when making the bed? Breakfast plentiful but busy and as previously stated my husband heard a senior staff member speaking in an aggressive manner to other staff members in full view of customers not the thing that should be done and needs to be dealt with by management ASAP.

The Premier Club lounge has a great view and offers a much more relaxed breakfast option and the evening happy hour includes drinks and snacks. Alcohol is quite pricey in Singapore so if you like a glass or two of wine in the evening, this is great.   The staff in the lounge were excellent and couldn't have been more helpful. We arrived at the hotel very early in the morning and while we were hopeful, we didnt expect to be in our room until later in the day.

The room had everything needed and the facilities were good.

Great location but misleading info provided,"When i booked this hotel, I was contacted via email there were no smoking rooms but there was a smoking area on level 4. Upon check in, the man said the same thing and then quickly said there actually was no smoking area at all, only outside on the street. If I knew that was the only place I could smoke, I would not have booked this hotel. As a result of this inconvenienve I didn’t end up spending much time at the hotel. Waste of money really. If you’re not a smoker, no issues for you - but it was the misleading information that the hotel provided me with that annoyed me.

All the staff here are excellent, they will do anything to make sure your stay is enjoyable. The selection of food  in the lounge for both breakfast and canapés in the evening was very, very good.  The only downside (which is the reason the Carlton hasn't received 5 out of 5) is the Wi-Fi. It is really awful, it's advertised as high speed but believe me it isn't and that really makes a difference.

AVERAGE HOTEL,"I will like to write a review compared to similar hotels in Singapore and else where in the world in price bracket and star rating DINING: Paper napkins in dining hall breakfast, 4/ 5 star hotels normally provide a cloth napkin.Not even a tea spoon but a wooden stirrer for coffee. For God's sake I was not at McDonald's.Fruits not cut well,just some chunks cut and thrown in for breakfast. To maintain the start rating the food has to be displayed well  Not adequate staff.A queue to get your eggs made is a terrible idea. And then to collect again.

We got a package to include a buffet breakfast which catered to all tastes, coffee and tea was not to our liking and thought that it could be improved. Showers area available on the fourth floor so that you may freshen up before your flights after booking out from your room. (Hard to keep things dry in this area. Maybe a storage area to place your suit case whilst in the shower could be included, otherwise suggest that you take the items from your suitcase and leave your bags in the holding area at checkin/checkout area.)",50,Sep-19,Undisclosed,22,49,Carlton
Very good,"Huge hotel ideally placed for both business and tourist interests delivered pretty much what I would expect.   I’ve seen several critical reviews of staff but I found from check in to concierge to cleaning staff everyone was smiling and genuinely helpful  The room was generic hotel but none the worse for that. Highlights were the fabulous mattress and efficient air-conditioning.   The bath was a little small and the control for drain plug was near broken and I had to twice get staff to come and let out the water.   Most disappointed though that lying there in my bubble bath I could only see the tv through the plate glass divider as there was no sound.

Excellent hotel close to MRTs,"I had a great experience at the hotel. I was located on the 24th floor. It was a very quiet floor. Great view of city. The room was very clean and spacious. The hotel is close to three mrt stations so I was able to use public transportation on my visit. Between 10-15 minutes to get to marina bay sands, Little India and Chinatown.   Only issue was that the breakfast was very expensive. Maybe it would have been cheaper if I included it in the room charge, but it was sd$38.   Overall I would highly recommend this hotel.

Well located hotel in Singapore,"Located near Raffles City shopping mall, Carlton Hotel is a 3 minute walk away from the City Hall MRT (Red and Green lines). Hence it is pretty convenient to be based out of the hotel.   Plenty of food to be found in the mall and Chijmes is just across the road. Easy check in and check out.   Room was spacious and clean, overlooking the swimming pool. Usual amenities of bottled water, free wifi, TV,  bath tub and shower and toiletries.   Paid about SGD222 all in for a night.

We were in Singapore for just two days on the way to the Maldives and this was a great way to see the highlights.

We know there is better,"The location of this hotel is excellent, just across Raffles shopping center and the Chjmes. The rooms would be good in size and also feel in good state. However the setting seems gloomy. Lots of grey, kind of dark, not so positive. May be just the wrong design or different design. Had extremely loud neighbours with small kids, wonder if there is also an issue with noise insulation. Other people on the floor left 3-4 bags of garbage outside the door (instant noodles and fast food stuff), the issue is not was there for most of the day and completely diminished the perceived quality of the house.

Relaxing stay in Premier Room,We took a risk with the cheaper non refundable rates on a premier room having stayed at this hotel previously. Our room on the 16th floor overlooked the Raffles Hotel swimming pool with a great view of the Marina Bay area. The room could not be faulted although it can take a day or two the work out the shower controls. We walked the couple of blocks to Bugis a few times to take advantage the cheap. The one small complaint is that the Handy phone battery had given up (Management to note - Room 1677) and was no longer functional. The Australian TV channel allowed us to watch all the AFL games over the weekend. Check out the gym and pool if you are that way inclined.,40,Aug-19,Undisclosed,24,43,Carlton

Service-wise, there was no real fault at all. You're met on arrival, luggage taken to the room and check-in was fairly swift. The only thing some might have an issue with is that they do take a deposit. I personally didn't have a big problem with this and the deposit was about 275 SGD.

Location perfect ,Having used the Carlton for work and pleasure before. The location for the price in the centre of Singapore is one that can’t be beaten. Premium club rooms and the lounge are looking a little dated compared to other properties in the area. However the options are sufficient for pre dinner drinks and breakfast is adequate.  Lots is within walking distance and you can escape the humidity by walking through the numerous interlinked shopping malls. ,40,Jun-19,Travelled as a couple,17,35,Carlton

The room included a 4g phone free to use that meant we could also call home for free. With the bonus of having mobile internet and maps meant we didn’t get lost   Situated right next door to the raffles hotel and shopping and chjimes complex over the road meant we were never far from anything   Would definitely recommend and will return if we come back ,50,Jun-19,Travelled as a couple,59,61,Carlton

We arrived early in the morning and they were able to fit us into a room before our agreed check-in time.  We had a the room as seen in the photo but I have seen other more luxurious rooms that must be in the new tower block.  We were left bottles of water each day.

The hotel is very well located right across the road from Raffles, Raffles City mall and the Chijmes complex. It's also an easy walk from Bugis, Suntec City and Gardens by the Bay.   We stayed in an Executive Club Room, which offered us plenty of space for a cot (also supplied by the hotel) and a great view over the pool area. Room itself is comfortable and well-maintained, and the Handy smartphone was great to help us navigate the city and make free calls back home. Common facilities are also great, and we made particular use of the dedicated kids' pool.

The valet was our favourite and we loved his happy, friendly banter. The hotel is in an excellent location - a short walk to restaurants, bars and shops.

Poolside bar offers nice drinks.  Restaurants in the hotel attract large crowds on weekends.  The restaurant in the lobby offers a mix of Asian and Western dishes, with a great buffet for breakfast.

Being honest we really didn’t get to utilise the services available so could of used a cheaper hotel but glad we didn’t; with a late evening flight and a midday checkout our luggage was looked whilst we spent another 4-5 hours exploring the city and there are shower facilities you can use to freshen up before you depart, that was VERY nice. The smart phone in the room is handy if you take the time to learn how to use it, you can (apparently)hook up your phone to it rather than use local wifi; we used it for google maps mainly.",50,May-19,Travelled as a couple,63,54,Carlton

We had club lounge access and this was disappointing compared to other hotels we have stayed at.  It was only little things but there was absolutely no view of the city at all, food was very mediocre and the range of drinks limited.  They did not have their own kitchen so everything was brought up from elsewhere.  Hash browns even had to be cooked in the toaster - never heard of that before!

Premium Rooms no longer impress,"Having returned for the fourth year Carlton is a mixture of delight and disappointment. Staff are courteous and professional as ever, with complimentary upgrade. However, the rooms even in the Premium Wing are getting rather dated and tired. Loose marble tile on the side of the bath, no USB sockets (even local buses have them for a good two years). They removed the nice espresso machine from Premium Rooms but not bother to update their website. I was promised one as a courtesy but it didn't work. It really wan't worth being woken up for at 7.45am after a bad night's sleep. I rang twice about a replacement but nothing happened all morning. Spoke to the front desk directly at midday.

We visited twice and were generously upgraded on both occasions to luxury suites. Breakfast buffet is exciting and high quality with a selection of Asian and European foods.

I asked for an extra bed and declared that for a 5 star hotel this is what I would expect, like I did many times around the world. They explained that I should have specified it at the reservation (on their own site, there is no option for a third bed...) and that it was an extra 80 $ but anyhow they don’t have any available.

We arrived in Singapore early in the morning (6am)and I booked two nights so that we had access to a room when we arrived. The hotel is very comfortable and proved to be really convenient for our plan to spend the morning on the “hop on hop off” bus to get an overview of Singapore and the afternoon shopping. The bus terminal is only a few blocks walk and Raffles shopping centre (excellent) is across the road. Raffles Hotel is next door should you want to try a Singapore Sling. Our room was great for an overnighter....... the glass partition between the beds and bathroom is not a preference but happily the toilet had a frosted glass door (even after 40 years of marriage we like our privacy). I’ve been to Singapore…,40,Mar-19,Travelled as a couple,180,131,Carlton
Poor for this class of hotel,Was disappointed with the Carlton  Had to change room due to stale odour. Next room had nuts on the floor from previous guests. Coffee making facilities but no cups. Rooms are dark and could do with refresh. Pool area is small and breakfast is like a zoo. Not my best experience in Singapore ,20,Apr-19,Travelled on business,73,53,Carlton
Great location and beautiful rooms,Open bathrooms with enclosed toilet/shower with modern looks. Such a good location in between 2 different train line stops and just right next to Raffles City and Chijmes for great food + shopping. Might not even need to leave the vicinity to have fun.,50,Mar-19,Travelled with friends,31,13,Carlton
Excellent location,"It is located in a great area. I managed to walk and visit everything like Clarke quay, marina area, little India , China. I recommend it. Breakfast selection is wide, lots of fruits, all types of Coffee. You will not need lunch.",40,Mar-19,Travelled on business,104,67,Carlton
Good time !,"Now the check-n process was easy and very welcoming. We had a seven night stay here and our room was on level two, the room was long and large we did not have view from the room this did not both us in the least. The bathroom size was very good and in particular the shower was a generous size, lovely hot water and nice towels, there was a bath also in the bathroom.As for the toiletries I have to say these were impressive all contained ! The room was immaculate, plenty of storage space, a safe which was a very good size and plenty of wardrobe space, the king bed was comfortable had the best nights sleep! The Concierges were excellent very helpful with any enquirers.

A satisfactory first stay,"We been travelling to Singapore frequently and decided to choose this hotel for this recent trip to experience the services and accommodation of the hotel. It was our first time staying in this hotel and overall it was pleasant.  The room assigned to us was according to our request. Raffles shopping mall was just  200 metre short walk, hence very convenient for quick bites and meals.  The breakfast at mosaic was however mediocre hence, out for 3 nights stay, we only had breakfast once.   The internet was working well for emails and usual surfing for information but unsure if it is adequate enough for streaming movies.  Check out was a breeze especially as early as 5.50am in the morning. Also,  catching a taxi with two big suit cases and two small ones at the LOBBY without…",40,Mar-19,Travelled as a couple,705,190,Carlton
Excellent long stay for work,"Superb stay. Our whole group was very pleased with our stay for work. We received complimentary upgrades and good rates. Great location: bus stop outside the hotel, MRT stations nearby, plenty of great eating spots in walking distance. Fantastic staff. Highly recommend.",50,Mar-19,Travelled on business,13,4,Carlton
We’ll be Back,"The hotel is perfectly positioned in the heart of Singapore. We received a complementary upgrade and WOW, what a beautiful room. 24th floor and a view that is breathtaking. The most amazing bathroom where spending time in the morning was a pleasure😆. Have been to Singapore a number of times before but never explored so much before because of the location of our hotel.  The breakfast was very good considering the amount of people they serve. All hotel staff were friendly and attentive. Will definitely be returning. ",50,Feb-19,Travelled as a couple,6,6,Carlton
Top Location and great room,"Carlton Hotel is the best location in Singapore City, MRT within walking distant, Next to Chimjes, Raffles City Mall..  The room hotel is great, luxury bathroom style, nice beds, but the breakfast in 19th floor needs improvement for 5 Stars Hotel.. They cant serve egg benedicts, less option of the foods, but its more private area with beautiful scenery ( we can see the Marina Bay Sands and Singapore Flyer)",50,Mar-19,Travelled as a couple,457,161,Carlton
Recommended hotel,"We were pleased to be upgraded to an executive room. Check in and check out were smooth and efficient. In room wifi was very good. Very comfortable and well appointed room. Housekeeping of a high standard. The Carlton is opposite Raffles place where you can walk underground all the way to Suntec City.  I would recommend Grab rather than local taxis where the drivers nowadays just sit in the car and do not help passengers with luggage at all which is a distinct downer for tourists. Singapore is clean and safe but it is a ""fine"" city - there are fines for everything. The Carlton SIngapore is recommended, no complaints at all.",40,Mar-19,Travelled as a couple,92,52,Carlton
Couldn’t do more to make us happy!,"Location good, room large and well equipped, breakfast superb!!! Very glad we picked this hotel!  Public transport is close by with Buses & underground very reasonably priced. Everywhere is air conditioned and boy, do we need it! Singapore does ‘polite’ to extremes! No one rushes, cars do not speed, and people are very helpful. Only thing is you need to understand what they are saying!!",50,Mar-19,Travelled as a couple,63,38,Carlton
"Beautiful, well run hotel, near public transit and restaurants.","Enjoyed a wonderful 4 night stay at this hotel in a club room.  Room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Club lounge had a great daily breakfast and wine and snacks in the evening.   Public transportation is just out the door and the area is full of restaurants & bars.  Jacquelyn, who oversees the lobby staff, does a magnificent job and is a delight to meet.  We would stay at this hotel again.  Highly recommended.",50,Feb-19,Travelled as a couple,53,45,Carlton
Stay and shop,"Chose this hotel because it is near to the shopping places like Bugis, Raffles City, Suntec, Marina Bay Sands and the whole of Orchard Road is accessible by walking or MRT. Check in was a breeze.  We were early as we wanted to have lunch nearby but the room was already available.  However, the extra bed and amenities were not in yet but since we left for lunch, they were put up in the room during our absence.  However, they forgot about the extra mug but since one of us didn't need it, we didn't remind housekeeping. The room is spacious and could accommodate an extra bed. There are a lot of cupboards and shelves and I love the vanity table cum desk.  All my toiletries were out of sight when I closed the cover. It is my first experience with the toilet separated from the shower…",40,Mar-19,Travelled with family,252,86,Carlton
"Overally, good stay at Carlton Hotel Singapore. Clean, quiet. Good environment...","Mall, foods can be found in walking distance. Staff are friendly and helpful too. Importantly the room soundproof is good! Room is clean and is well maintain! Only down point, they have little TV channels, but it is still good for us as we barely spend too long hours in hotel room.",40,Mar-19,Travelled with family,4,0,Carlton
Excellent,"Stayed here for four nights in late February.  The hotel is well positioned probably about 4 minutes walk from two MRT stations.  We were in a Club room so had use of that facility which was undoubtedly a bonus.  The lounge was quite large and although there were a lot of people there at times, service was always excellent.  Our room was quite spacious and housekeeping excellent.  In fact, the service provided by all staff was at a very high level.  While this is a busy hotel, both check in and check out were seamless.  I can't really think of one thing about this hotel on which I could comment negatively.  If I return to Singapore, this would be my choice for hotel accommodation",50,Feb-19,Travelled as a couple,52,42,Carlton
Great Staff,"Excellent hotel perfect position and what impressed us most was the staff...although there was a mix up on our inclusive breakfast that got sorted all ok....the breakfast buffet all food covered, very comfortable bed.",40,Mar-19,Travelled with family,202,82,Carlton
Very good location ,"I love this location!! You won’t feel bored at all.  City hall station is just next to me, Chijmes just across the street. And they provided handy in the room, I ordered room service at 2am.  Outdoor swimming pool and gym are at 5/F.   I don’t even need to go Sentosa beach for suntan.  Very recommended!!",50,Mar-19,Travelled on business,30,12,Carlton
"Top location, room a bit average","Stayed here for a couple of nights in a premier club room which we thought was quite small for the price we paid. On entering  our room we quickly noticed a smell that we thought was stale urine in the bathroom which was horrendous. This disappeared after we flushed the sink, bath, and shower with water for a few minutes. There was also a four pack of kim chee the housemaids had left us in the minibar, yuck! Apart from that the hotel was in top condition, clean, and staff were friendly and helpful. The club on the 19th floor was a nice quiet place to relax while we had our complimentary canapes and drinks  while admiring the view of the city. ",40,Mar-19,Travelled as a couple,173,90,Carlton
Just fine. ,"The location is my favorite feature of this hotel.  It's right in front of Chijmes which is full of options to eat and also across a mall. Several bus stops are within the area so it's also very easy to go around.   Only thing that bothered me a little was the layout of the room. When you enter you are immediately greeted by the bathroom sink on your right side. Kind of bizarre as it doesn't really have a partition.   Anyway, it was ok but for the price you can get larger rooms with adequate cabinets. Our room didn't have one and you may obly hang your clothes through an open rod.   Service is okay. ",30,Mar-19,Travelled on business,258,28,Carlton
City hotel,"This is a well priced city hotel, easy access to everything and very friendly and helpful staff. The rooms are clean and well sized - ask for a nice view and the city view is stunning. Even the door man is lovely with a great sense of humour......this all makes for a pleasant stay.",50,Mar-19,Travelled as a couple,57,37,Carlton
Good location hotel,"I stayed here during 2018 Christmas in the nice view room on high floor. The room was really good, can't really blame anything. There was a bit of confusion with the room clean but the receptionist handled it perfectly. Just the breakfast, I stayed here for 3 nights but the morning buffet does not change much.",40,Dec-18,Travelled as a couple,11,6,Carlton
Nice functional hotel,"This is a nice hotel. The room is reasonably sized, the bed was comfortable, and the hotel is well located in an area with plenty of shopping malls and ‘heritage’ walks around the older buildings of Singapore.  The hotel would be well suited for business travellers (it has a large business centre and good gym) and families.",40,Mar-19,Travelled as a couple,67,11,Carlton
Great Hotel To Stay,"Stayed 3 nights in this hotel with good sleeping quality and room environment. Great service since the umbrella to be borrowed while raining. Great breakfast, lunch and tea time. Easy access to shopping mall, food places and others historical place.",40,Jan-19,Travelled on business,42,4,Carlton
Great service in a comfortable hotel,"I booked a one night stay prior to a cruise out of Singapore, followed by a further 3 night stay at the end of the cruise. Firstly, the staff at front desk were amazing. Smartly dressed, very polite and efficient and nothing too much trouble. Check-in was seamless and we scored an upgrade on the one night stay- bonus! On our return for the 3 night stay, we were checked in very early without any hassle- very grateful for this.  Our room on both occasions was lovely. We were upgraded to the Premier Club room that we booked for the second part of our stay. The room was spacious and very comfortable. Best of all was the Sealy bed. We generally find Asian hotels favour beds a little too firm for our taste so it was great to have a comfy bed. Also of note were the micogel pillows 😀So…",50,Feb-19,Travelled as a couple,107,53,Carlton
Premier Rooms are fantastic,"Room was large and airy with the window capable of being opened. Room came with a King Size bed and the staff ensured that it was always neat and tidy. Access to a large bathroom with a walk in shower plus a bath. Amenities included a TV, Refrigerator and Air Conditioning. Because of the Premier Room access was granted to the Premier Lounge where one could have breakfast and dinner. Drinks were included Staff were always helpful and very obliging.",50,Mar-19,Travelled with family,379,119,Carlton
Very nice hotel in central location ,The Carlton hotel is situated fairly well right across raffles hotel and the long bar and a large shopping centre. There is an MRT close by and you can also jump on the hop on hop off bus again just across the road.   The hotel reception is very grand and the staff are very friendly and helpful all speaking very good English.   We were upgraded to a premier room which had more space and a great view out to the city towards marina bay. The room itself had all you should expect with modern decor.   As we were only in Singapore 3 days we didn’t get the chance to use many of the hotel facilities and the many restaurants.   We did use the pool small but what you would expect from an inner city hotel.   Enjoyable stay would recommend. ,40,Feb-19,Travelled as a couple,76,46,Carlton
Amazing Hotel and great customer service ,"We stayed here for a couple of nights before we left to Sidney, Australia. When we arrived the porters immediately unloaded the suitcases from our van. We checked in and our we asked for an upgrade to a premium room. The room had a fantastic view of the city.   The location of the hotel was perfect. The On and Off Bus was very close to the hotel. There were plenty of shops and places to eat around the hotel. The hotel provided Nespresso machines with three capulets.  The bathroom was extremely luxurious with so much room. The tub was enclosed by glass and looks into the room. Very impressive. They provided slippers and a robe.   On the day we left, the hotel provided showers and an area to freshen up before our red eye flight to Sidney.   I highly recommend this hotel. Great…",50,Feb-19,Travelled with family,54,20,Carlton
Carlton Hotel/Singapore Restaurants,Stayed here 3rd year in a row and the concierge Ali and doorman Yunus were fantastic as always and very helpful. Wah Lok restaurant has great food for dinner and may be somewhat pricey but very good and also excellent service from the staff. Tried chilli crab at Restaurant With No Brand at Geylang and nice crab but very pricey and would not be going there again as I would rather pay the same amount and get excellent food and service at Wah Lok even though food is different but chilli crab is chilli crab and very small serving for the price and SGD30 for a plate of palin vegetables!!!,40,Feb-19,Travelled with family,30,5,Carlton
Nice view and near mrt,"First time travelled with the 2 kids, me and my wife choose this hotel. When we arrived the hotel, they give us check in early. Thank you very much. The room very clean and nice view. Only the bathroom a bit small, my wife had a trouble when bathed the kids. Breakfast at the lounge was wonderful with the good view, especially the chinese lady staff Rebecah. She was very friendly and good with the kids. The foods was nice, the porridge very nice.

Great hotel. Free upgrade,I went there for my wedding anniversary last week and it was amazing. Loved the hotel. The location was awesome. Staffs were great. My wife and I both had a good time.

Luxury hotel which gives us a feel like home,"It was one of the best hotel in Singapore as we were hosted by Peter Chua (Front Office Manager), He was very attentive in anything during our stay in Carlton hotel. If you need more informations about the hotel and surrounding or any helps to get transport or things to discover in Singapore, then he is the man. The room was nice, tidy and comfort, the room is also facilitated with handy (smart phone) which I found so useful as I just stayed one night in town (no singapore SIM card needed) and I love the fact that they provide Nespresso coffee machine with the variety of capsules (I could get my afternoon/morning coffee just in my room) And not forget to mention the premium collection of toiletries and good quality of bathrobe is one of my favorites too.

The check in was fabulous which they allowed us to get into our room earlier than the normal check in time 14.00.

From the airport, you just need to take the train to Tanah Merah and then transfer to the green line to Tuas Link. Just get off the train on the 9th stop (City Hall). The hotel is just a block away.   The room that I got was spacious. Separate bath tub and shower. Comfortable bed. Free wifi. They also have a handy phone that you can use. Free local calls. Free data 4G. There’s a minimal fee if you want to use the handy phone as a personal hotspot. The gym was okay. It has a small sauna. The pool was nice.

Christmas,Checked I  just after Christmas day.  There was still a festive atmosphere and the lobby was tastefully decorated. The rooms were large and luxurious. The breakfast was ample and tasty although it felt a little like a canteen.   Probably because of the volume of people due to the ime of year.   Would definitely stay again.  Hotel central to most attractions,50,Dec-18,Travelled as a couple,145,42,Carlton
Very poor service ,"I checked in to find the hot water wasn’t working in my room. After unpacking I was then told I needed to change rooms. I asked for an upgrade for the inconvenience and was actually moved to a smaller room. Very poor communication from management and finally an offer to move, for a second time to a new and bigger room. For a four star hotel in Singapore with many other options I was very disappointed with accountability from management and problem solving. I won’t stay here again.

Good central location and hotel facilities ,"We stayed here for 4 nights, from New Year’s Eve. When we arrived, the hotel had another group in the rooms (I assume to make extra $ from New Year’s Eve patrons) so we could not check in until 10pm.   The staff were apologetic but I think this was a poor decision on the management side just to make extra dollars. From a 7hr flight we had to wait another 5hrs to checkin to a room we had prebooked and paid for months in advance. They did offer us compensation of a room upgrade and a bottle of wine for this inconvenience.   Apart from that issue, the hotel staff were attentive and the hotel was modern clean and close to most attractions such as Chinatown, Maxwell Hawker Centre and other attractions.

My only criticisms are that the concierge is not tremendously helpful (it took quite a bit of dialog to get clear directions, and their restaurant recommendations did not jibe with online reviews), and there seems to be no way to say 'don't change the sheets and towels everyday to save water'.

Nice Hotel,The staff were very attentive to my needs.  Service was excellent.  The position of the Carlton is convenient for the MRT which is the easiest way to to get around Singapore but if taxis are required these are easily obtained by the hotel.

Decent enough hotel,"Had to stay at the Carlton when a flight was cancelled. I thought the staff were great, and they knew exactly what they were doing given the very short notice they must have had in sorting our rooms out.  The rooms were decent enough, quite dated but ok. Breakfast was average, but made up for my an excellent choice at dinner.  For a midrange 5* (ie 4 star) you may want to consider the Carlton ",40,Oct-18,Travelled solo,110,123,Carlton

I got a number for a girl who found the phone - he phoned her, get her to wait outside her house for me and then arranged a taxi driver to take me there and use his personal phone to phone the girl when I arrived.

In spite of being next to the lifts it was blissfully quiet.  The bathroom was well equipped but thank goodness for the privacy blind to the shower to spare our collective blushes.  The beds were very comfortable and we slept soundly.  Our room overlooked the pool which we made good use of.  In terms of position it really is very central and within easy walking distance of public transport and a variety of shops and restaurants.  On a negative note, the instant coffee provided…",40,Aug-18,Travelled with family,19,21,Carlton
Good location to MRT stations but uncomfortable pillows,"I stayed in a deluxe twin room for 4 nights. A very good location for getting to different MRT lines. Decent breakfast if you're not looking for a Le Méridien kind of spread. Attentive and friendly staffs. Only thing I'm not satisfied is the pillows. They are uncomfortable to me. I have not request for a new pillow so I'm not sure if it would be any different if I did. Overall, pleasant experience. ",40,Aug-18,Travelled solo,167,14,Carlton

2nd visit a disappointment ,"We stayed in the Carlton in February and were really impressed by the quality, customer service and high standard of this hotel. This stay influenced my decision to return to the Carlton as I loved the hotel. Unfortunately this time, our visit left us underwhelmed.   We arrived at 5 pm and had 2 rooms booked. I had emailed the hotel and requested both rooms on the same high floor with king beds. When we checked in, we were offered twin rooms but on different floors. After mentioning our request we were finally given king rooms on the same floor but only one room was available as the other was still being cleaned.

They didn't offer to take bags to the room and watched me struggle with a large suitcase with a broken wheel on checking in and I had to lug it across the foyer to get into the lift The lobby is a good seating area to work but no staff ever ask if you'd like a drink.

For Those With Gluten Intolerance...,"This Hotel would have received 5 stars were it not for the fact that the food choices were extremely limited for those with gluten intolerance issues. In fact, if you are gluten intolerant/celiac, then be prepared to spend a lot of time researching where you can eat or bring your own food. There is a great deal of ignorance in Singapore with regard to this issue. It’s a pity as it makes visiting here much harder than it needs to be.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"The hotel was good but I was expecting more from the service and the room itself is just ok given the price and my window view is not good too. I went out for lunch but when I came back the room was not fixed, she only gave me a towel for replacement. I told her just to go back at 5:45 because I have dinner at 6 but she is 20 min early and so she was cleaning while Im still inside the room. The cleaner was polite and corteous and I noticed she was alone cleaning too many rooms. Maybe thats why she was lacking of time so she needs to do everything out of schedule (late or ahead). Some peeps on the concierge were nice and some were not and inefficient. No photos haha didn't took any. Nothing interests me.",30,Jul-18,Travelled on business,3,4,Carlton

Fabulous central place to stay,This motel was an unknown (a guess) we were both pleasantly surprised. Our room was lovely with lots of space. We paid the extra money for the club room and are so glad we did. The staff were wonderful and helpful. The club room was great and had a great view from the balcony towards MBS and the city skyline.  Our whole experi nice of this supposedly 4 star motel was 5 star service. We didn’t fly out until 9pm and they arranged for us to have a 6pm checkout. Service plus in our opinion.  They have a pool and a spa and there were children there if you have a young family. Easy access for cabs and buses within walking distance. Would definitely recommend this motel to anyone. 10/10 for sure,50,Jul-18,Travelled as a couple,10,2,Carlton

Short Business Trip,Stayed here for 3 nights in July while on business. More than adequate hotel from accommodation point of view with decent pool and gym as well.  The business centre was a bit basic and felt like you were stepping back in time in terms of facilities.

"Beautiful studio room, but subpar service a disappointment","Stayed in a studio room for two nights in preparation for our wedding at a church in the vicinity. The room itself was clean and spacious, beautifully laid out and with excellent views of the city from the bedroom and bathroom windows, while the breakfast spread on both mornings was tasty and varied. Despite the beautiful room, service was subpar in comparision from the moment we stepped into the hotel.

Travel in Style,"Worst experience and false marketing. The worst hotel we have ever stayed in. We stayed two nights in this hotel on our way to and from Vietnam so experienced two different rooms, one basic and the other Premium Club. On the 'basic' side the room was standard, painted neutral, no artwork, no kettle, coffee or tea, bar fridge had one Beer and some soft drinks. Pool Bar was pretty ordinary. We went out for dinner! On our return Premium Club promised Cocktails and Canapés as part of the room cost. This is false marketing and on arrival at the Premium Club Lounge dressed to code, we were greeted by a gentleman who asked for our room number and what would we like to drink. I asked for a Martini and my husband for a Lemon, lime and bitters. Oh no we cannot make either of those drinks.…",10,Jun-18,Travelled as a couple,25,5,Carlton

The hotel also provides a mobile phone in the room, which you can use to make local calls and access the Internet while you’re out and about (think Google Maps).  It’s not the cheapest hotel out there, but it certainly exceeded my expectations. Most of these 5 star hotels are the same, but this one goes just that little extra mile.

I like Carlton because it is located away from busy malls and subways yet close enough for easy access so there is privacy and convenience. I am not sure how the standard rooms are because it is a pretty old hotel. But I wish the operator can do a better job at being nice. She was quite grumpy on the line.

Love Singapore BUT..,"Thought we would try a new hotel this visit. Priority in our choosing is always the location.  We prefer the Raffles area as close to many things including good access to brilliant train system. The room design is off putting with open bathroom as you walk in.   No enclosed robes so your hanging clothes visible.    No block out curtains, just see thru type.   In the afternoon and evening the sun streams thru and makes it difficult to see TV. We had need to call ""Engineering:"" for three issues, one is a design fault with the shower.   Don't use the ""rain"" shower head as water will leak into toilet area.

We paid the extra to be in the Club room which was so worth it.  The breakfast was wonderful, as is the view from the lounge area.  The drinks and canapes were more than worth it.

Huge, with a massive bathroom which included a bathtub and shower. However our second room we were given for our April stay was about half the size in comparison. There was no bathtub, not even any bathrobes in the room. This was a disappointment as we only booked a return stay based on our first experience.

We ordered room service and the food was surprisingly top-notch. Service was solid. Our pre-booking for a day-use room went on without a hitch and staff were friendly.   We are already thinking of when we can book another stay! This four-star hotel surely over performs on expectations.  Room tip: choose the studio rooms, which are well worth the upgrade.

"Very disappointing, poor performance, no ambiance.","We came by to see if we would stay in this hotel. In the lobby (some chairs were dirty) we ordered two tea. Our regular choice (Rooibos) was not available. The ambiance was poor and it was very quiet, nevertheless it took more then 10 minutes for serving two tea pots and two ordinary cookies. In the meanwhile I visited the restrooms where I found a dirty smell and a wet floor, certainly not of cleaning. We decided not to stay and asked for the bill. We paid ~ Euro 25,00. No tip, no value for money.  We were happy that two people opened the door when leaving the hotel. Yes, that was full service but too late. ",20,Mar-18,Travelled as a couple,69,49,Carlton

Large Room Great Location,My partner and I with our 4 year old stayed here for 2 nights in an executive room with buffet breakfast. The room was king size and bed comfortable. Breakfast was really big.   We took the train from the airport as the taxi line was massive. It cost us less than $5! We got off at city hall and walked out and our hotel was right there. Great location a lot of shopping malls.  Suggest to use Bras Basah MRT if your going to the Singapore Flyer or marina bay. We got a big lost walking to the esplanade MRT thru city hall.   Taxi are very cheap. It was $20 to go to jurong bird park which was 20min drive ,50,Feb-18,Travelled with family,37,29,Carlton
Excellent .............!!,Stopped off here for two days on the way to NZ. I found the staff excellent and super friendly in what is a really nice hotel. It is ideally situated next to Raffles Hotel ( closed till end of the year ) and a large shopping centre with a fantastic food court. Within the shopping centre is a station for the metro which is the easiest and hassle free way to get around the sights of Singapore. A very relaxing and enjoyable stay was had so I would have no hesitation in staying here again or recommending it to others.,40,Feb-18,Travelled as a couple,19,49,Carlton
Top Job Carlton,"This was not your average hotel visit.  It had been intended to be a quick 2 night stay with our sons, before heading back to Europe.

Couldn’t do more for us.,"This is one of those reviews that could easily have gone the other way, lol. Having been on the go for nearly 12 hours we arrived at the hotel and checked in, it being the Chinese New Year it was obviously very busy but this didn’t really cause any issues as the reception staff were very professional. We noted that we were missing a bed in our room (we had paid for 2 adults and one <12 child).  Wife called reception and was originally told that their were no additional beds (Chinese NY) and the best they could do was a blanket and pillow for the floor or 3 in a bed!

Avoidable.,"Lazy Service. The patisserie would shut down before time for no reason. Choice of vegetarian food was very poor and the staff were not inclined to help. If you are vegetarian, take the room without a breakfast option since you will have a choice of a few things in the buffet. We shifted to Intercontinental afterwards and that had a great spread in breakfast. Replenishment of coffee and tea and toilet rolls was random in the rooms. most hotel even though they block your card, let you pay by cash. They refused outright in this case. Other colleagues who stayed in the same hotel (same booking rate) got better rooms with bath tubs, etc. We got the worst lot of two rooms.",20,Feb-18,Undisclosed,49,21,Carlton

Check in was quick with the check in lady rattling off information like a speeded up robot , so fast we couldn't understand what she was saying!

Room was quite pleasant, bright and clean but with open bathroom area , whats with these hotels with all these open glassed in areas with no proper privacy? There was no wardrobe, just a hanging rail which was not ideal. The worst thing about this hotel is the breakfast dining room!

GOOD VALUE HOTEL,"My family and I stayed for 2 nights (which included New Years Eve) on our way to Europe.  I tried booking some other hotels in Singapore, but their rates were ridiculously high over New Year’s Eve.  The rates at the Carlton Hotel were very good, so I went ahead and booked this hotel.  The location of the hotel is excellent.  My son and I used the gym, and I would rate it as a very good hotel gym.  The hotel has an outdoor swimming pool.  However, we found the water temperature to be a bit cold, probably because it was located between two buildings and didn’t seem to get much sunlight.

A hotel that needs to review its kitchens,The Carlton hotel is a bit of a quandary to assess.  It’s rooms are spacious and although a little needing of a refit are still of a good quality for this 4 Star Hotel.  The facilities are good as well with a fairly well appointed gym and pool.  What is disappointing is that this hotel was once well known for its buffet and menu.  It was once a place where local residents would go for a buffet in the past.  Much like the Shangri-La Hotel Line restaurent today.  When you rate a hotel the standard of its buffet and menus are an essential part of that assessment.  For this reason I have given a hotel that should get a 4 in all rights as a 4 Star Hotel the rating of a 3.  The buffet was poorly thought out.

The coffee shop in the lobby is quite enough for a short business meeting and good quality is decent.   Rooms are average size for Singapore.I found the bed mattress and pillows too soft. Bathroom was small. Room service menu does not have too many vegetarian options. Breakfast was a decent spread each day.   Overall a decent 4 star hotel and decent value for the price you pay.   ,40,Sep-17,Travelled on business,74,91,Carlton
Great choice of accommodation ,"This is a really well located hotel. One block away from the MRT station and 5 minute walk to the Bugis markets. Maps were provided when requested and the concierge took the time to point out areas of interest. On the adjacent corner is a great shopping centre too and in the basement there is a money changer. Rate was ok but it was a tad cheaper at the airport.  The rooms are a great size and quite modern. I was disappointed that although we were staying 2 nights, Milk & sugar was only provided for one night. Not a big problem but it takes a while for room service to arrive.  The pool area was really nice and I really wished we had more time there to use the pool.  When we checked in, they took $100 from my card for incidentals which wasn’t returned when checking out. They tell…",40,Jan-18,Travelled with family,38,15,Carlton
"Great hotel, poor patron behaviour","This is the second time I have stayed here at the carlton hotel and once again my review is mixed and therefore would be unlikely to return. Firstly Thank you to the hotel for upgrading my room on our honeymoon, the room was modern and had spectacular views. Unfortunately on both nights we stayed, it looked like our room was surrounded by tour groups who were there to party and this went onto into.the early hours of the morning on both nights. Whilst this was necessarily the hotels fault, staff would drop by to drop of food and didn't really address the matter.

"Not five star - but nice, clean, excellent location, superior service","I recently stayed one night at Carlton on a business trip.  It seems to be a quasi touristy and business hotel around mid- to lower upper range.  the entry is large and spacious but not overly zealous like the casinos  All around, service is attentive and friendly.  The rooms are decent size, in the four star range - not new or lush, but quite nice, clean, etc.  there seems to be a pool and spa here, but i didn't visit.

Plenty of places to visit and eat at all through the day and night, right out outside. Hotel itself is very clean, rooms are spacious and service is solid. Shower is strong.

Best beds in Singapore ,"We only had one night here after a couple of weeks in Thailand.  We were made welcome from the minute we arrived. The reception desk arranged a late check out for us to coincide with our flight. The room was spacious and the bed and pillows were like sleeping on a cloud. That with the blockout curtains, we had the best night sleep in ages.  The hotel is well located, close to the underground train station and shopping malls.  There was also the use of a complementary mobile phone.  You could take the phone out with you, it had free unlimited internet (great for looking up maps while out and about) and we also could make free unlimited phone calls back to Australia (land lines only) That was just the icing on the cake.  We would definitely stay there again next time we come back…",50,Jan-18,Travelled with family,149,61,Carlton
Busy hotel but brilliant location ,"We used the Carlton Hotel as our base for 7 nights in Singapore. It’s a busy business style hotel but in a convenient location. Right across the road from CHIJMES, a 3 minute walk to the MRT and 10 minutes to Suntec City (arguably the best shopping complex in Singapore), you can’t get much more ‘located’ than this.   Rooms are modern and comfortable with blackout curtains that can create the extra sleep time you may need after a night out. Staff were very friendly and the hotel as a whole was exceptionally clean. We will return to Singapore and will look at staying here again or at the Marriott (close by) to be in the location. ",40,Jan-18,Travelled as a couple,70,78,Carlton

Breakfast has all the usual suspects that you would expect from a club floor. The coffee is not too bad for a hotel coffee machine,and the lovely staff will always get you one . the toaster is dreadful and often burnt one side of the toast.(why can't hotels ever get their toasters right ? ) cold stringy bacon ,some asian foods and an unimpressive buffet, THERE ARE NO CONDIMENTS TO BE SEEN,why are there no sauces or condiments ??and I had to ask for pepper and salt shakers.

In reality not all Premier rooms have that view. Luckily after the first night the staff found another room for us with gorgeous view. Access to the Club Lounge is a nice experience especially for happy hour as you can have food and drinks basically replacing the dinner. The gym was ok but the swimming pool was very small. So don’t count on swimming there if only for dipping like many people do after the gym without even taking shower! The breakfast was ok, we liked the fruits selection.

We know that some guests would only wake up at 9:00 am so to have a room ready for us at that time of the day and of the year was just amazing. Secondly, we were up-graded from left tower to Premium Tower with a generous size room. It is a shame we cannot recall the Receptionist name, he should have his name mentioned on Trip Advisor under outstanding service category.  We rented a car from the airport so we needed a car park space which came for free, under one condition: to grab a bar coded pass from Concierge for every exit.

A free smartphone is an unusual but handy extra in all rooms!   Had a Studio Room, with a free-standing bathroom as big as the room and with an excellent view of the city.

I booked this hotel for a guest overseas. Due to some accident he couldn’t check in on the original date and so i went to check in instead. Upon checking in i was told i needed an email verification from him in order to check in EVEN THOUGH i was the one who paid for and booked the hotel.

The Great Indifference,"The feeling we took away from our weekend at the Carlton was one of indifference - from the reservations to the check-in to the room service.   The tone is that of casual disinterest. You ask for X and they will give you X but with very few niceties. It puts the ""business"" in the ""business hotel"".  It is a pity as I recall service was a lot better years ago when we held our wedding banquet at the hotel.   This is also why we decided to have a family staycation there around the time of my wedding anniversary. I told the reservations the reason for my stay while booking. A more attentive hotel would have given us a wedding anniversary greeting during our check-in.  Sure, the location is great and the room is clean but it was really the details that let down.

Service here was lovely but the choice of breakfast was limited and never changing, as were the evening snacks, more meal than accompaniments to drinks.

2nd Stay at the Carlton Hotel,"My husband and I had a stay in late September at the Carlton hotel for 6 nights. This is our second stay here, the first being 4 years ago in 2013.  We again chose to stay in a Premier room - although the other wing has now been renovated (it was not when we stayed 4 years ago!) we enjoyed this room last time so went with it again.   The hotel was nice enough to grant my request for a high floor with a view out to marina bay - the room number was 1869 - you can definitely catch the left side of Marina Bay sands from the room window.

Nice hotel in a good location,"The Carlton Hotel is quite nice and in a central location. The lobby was a great place to meet with colleagues and always had a bit of buzz going on. The rooms were nice. Not huge but had all of the features that I require. It's a fairly large hotel, but you never had to wait for an elevator.   The only problem I had was that the gym and pool area didn't open until 7AM. That doesn't work for those on business as you don't have enough time to work out before the day starts. The one time I was able to get to the gym, I found it to be nice and well equipped.   Because not getting into the gym before work is a deal-breaker for me, I likely wouldn't stay here again.

Several years ago the Carlton hotel was extended by the construction of the new tower, which the hotel refers to as its premier wing. This is certainly a good place to stay in.

The Premier Club Room is spread across 34sq.m. and was appointed suitably well. The room that we were offered however looked onto the rear side of an adjacent building thereby denying us of any interesting views. I found that especially odd, since the staff remarked to me that since it was a long weekend, they weren't as busy. We were booked in to stay for five nights and I thought the hotel would use it's discretion to offer a better view for guests staying that long.

very pleasant stay,"nice room, bed and pillow are comfortable, i got to sleep very well. i got a room that faces the other (older) block and also the swimming pool, i didnt find that an issue, and i think perhaps room facing inside are more quiet. spacious room and good seating spots. breakfast has been the same for the three days of my stay, cant complain much, they taste good. shopping and eating is just across the street. wide selection too, there is a building with some used/second hand book stores, worth a visit if you like books, some craft store and art galleries there too",50,Aug-17,Travelled on business,25,6,Carlton
Understated and practical,"Hotel exterior and interior itself is nothing grand nor glamorous - the room is understated in design, cosy and practical for business trips.  I stayed for a full week business trip - and found everything I needed and indeed feel quite at home.   It is not your luxurious hotel but their service is outstanding - the staff go the extra miles, very polite and they do service from the heart - without hesitation.  One of the room service waiter came in and accidentally stepped on my slipper, it was not a big deal, but he made the effort to bring me back a new pair.  I struggled to connect my USB driver to play my movies on their TV - turns out it was a set model and does not have that function.  The engineer who came to fix it came back within five minutes, and to my surprise, he…",50,Aug-17,Travelled on business,280,124,Carlton
Comfortable hotel in the heart of Singapore,"Very good hotel in the heart of Singapore. International standard. Asian service. Pool is OK but not the best if you plan to combine pool time with visits. Booking systems were down when we arrived. We we asked to wait. One hour later, nothing had changed.

An perfectly ran exotic getaway with all amenities you would expect from a top hotel,"I could not make myself leave their amazing pool!   I've stayed there for a few days and it was one of the best experiences in my life.  Love it. Will go back again. The elevator on the side of the building with a clear panoramic wall was a bit scary for I am afraid of the heights. Only thing I did not like- we had a medical emergency happened to us but hotel did not have a medically trained personnel to attend to us. But they did put me on a line with Singaporean hospital and I followed the directions and sorted the situation out myself.

Usual high standard,Same high standard that I have come to expect from the Carlton. A stay in the 'new' tower with a view over Raffles was nice. The proximity to the lift seemed as if it would be a noisy hassle but wasn't. Breakfast was good. Check In and Out was painless and ease of getting a taxi was good. Proximity to local venues is always good and only half the price of other nearby hotels!,40,Jul-17,Travelled on business,12,8,Carlton
"Nice room, need to refurbish some parts. Excellent location","Carlton located at a very central area with short distance to Orchard road, to Marina Bay and other parts.

Cleanliness of room need to be improved though the cleaner maid is a nice woman. Room acoustic is not so good, people with louder voice was easily be heard at next room or at corridor. Room design is simply and comfort. Overall staffs are nice and helpful, in-room food service is good and tasteful.  In conclude, this is a average rating hotel at this price but if a buffet breakfast was included, it should be a plus mark.",30,Aug-17,Travelled with family,11,3,Carlton

Used Uber a lot and picks and drop offs were no problem with an average wait of 5 min. Avg price around town was a little under $10. MRT and plenty of food options just across the road (including a small supermarket in the raffles mall basement.

Pros - great location, comfy bed, great price compared to what we have paid in the past at the Fairmont and Swissotel across the road. Smart phone is a good move plus we didn't need our adaptor. Smart thinking Carlton. Overall, I found it better value for money.  Cons - still trying to work out where the power point in the bathroom was. I ended up doing my hair at the desk. Strange. Staff at the pool bar had no idea where the sauna is. Found it after checking TripAdvisor. The staff need to smile more.

Singapore perfect,"Locally run Carlton hotel is a great example of ""hometown service""-- efficiently run with minimal fuss or presumption, but with high quality for price. Check-in and out was a breeze for us even though there are lots of tour groups from China.   Yes there are more expensive and cheaper rooms in Singapore, but in my opinion, the value for money is high here especially compared to the Raffles Hotel next door.  The location in the Civic center is close to 3 different MRT stations/Lines (City Hall, Bugis, and Bras Basah), providing easy access to Orchard shopping, Marina Bay shows, or Little India eating.  Lots of high end or lower end eating at Chimes across the street or the food court at the bottom of Raffles City Mall.

Perfect Location,Stayed for 2 nights. Situated at the back of The Raffles Hotel. Was upgraded to the premier wing - lovely room. Big bathroom. The Smart phone they give you is brilliant for google maps & researching things to do.  The location is perfect to use the MRT which is so cheap & easy to use.  We ate at The Raffles City food court & also at Chijmes which is so beautiful at night with the lights on the church. Sat by the pool for a swim & cocktails - just push the buzzer & a waiter arrives to take your order.  Would definitely stay again. ,50,Aug-17,Travelled as a couple,36,14,Carlton

We were very happy with our choice. The Carlton is very well located at the junction of Bras Basah and North Bridge Roads, across the road from Chijmes restaurant complex, Raffles Hotel and Raffles Shopping Centre. City Hall MRT is a short walk away and the National Gallery and Asian Civilisations Museum are also within easy walking distance.

Taxis are also very cheap and easy to pick up at the front door. I don't understand the criticisms about customer service and checking in and out - if you arrive as part of a large party, it will take longer to check in, but for couples and solos, there is no delay, unless half a plane-load of couples have arrived at the same time.  After all, one cannot expect walk into a hotel or shop and expect to find someone just waiting to serve ""me"". Similarly, I don't understand the comment the breakfast package.

Very happy. I would come back.,After travelling for 4 weeks it was refreshing to come to a real 4 star hotel. It is a busy hotel and the staff work very hard to ensure your comfort. Breakfast is a feast to behold. The rooms are very well appointed and comfortable. It's central location makes it easy to get around to many of the sights by foot and the public transport system and tourist bus stop is close. Raffles is next door for your Singapore sling hit. ,40,Aug-17,Travelled solo,59,41,Carlton
Poor customer service at the reception ,The hotel is good and it's location is also very close to most of the attractions. However the biggest issue is with the check in and check out process. It just takes forever. There are not many people at the reception and I had to wait for about 15 minutes during checking in and about 30 mins while checking out. It's just frustrating to see the speed at which the staff does the processing.,20,Aug-17,Travelled on business,200,100,Carlton

At hotel, if you take hot noodles, you need to pay 11 SGD more than bread food. This is ridiculous. If you take one bread and one noodle, SGD 33.if you take only bread , it is SGD 22.

Large flat screened TVs internet access at an extra charge for the room but plenty of free places within the hotel the bathroom was luxury incarnated.

The pool is a bit small, but located in a cool middle-of-the-tower location that gets nice breezes. So overall, the Carlton is a great place, and somewhere I'd consider staying again.   On the down side, it is clear that the management of the hotel is looking to make it a tech-forward location, but not really being successful at it. There's a mobile phone in the room.

Not the best as far as service and response is concerned,"We stayed here 13-15th July 2017. The hotels' location is its best attribute. The rooms are fairly large open and airy, There is no covered wardrobe only an open closet so in effect the room looks messy as soon as you enter as all your clothes are hanging there. So also the hand was area which is open and outside the bath area- so as soon as you enter the room you see ones personal stuff all over the place which is very embarrassing if you have a visitor.  My personal experience was not the greatest as I had to move my 21 year old son to my room as a third occupant as he was very ill. 1.

We stayed in 2230 and our room, at the end of the corridor, looked directly into another building (about 1.5-2m) away. I think the bathroom was good with a bath, shower and toilet but with full windows, you had to put the blinds fully down to get privacy, even for the toilet. The bedroom area was not large, but comfortable. Location, as others has said, it excellent, but having stayed also at the Swissotel The Stamford which is across the road for a similar price, I wouldn't choose to stay here again.

A bonus was opening windows. Tea and coffee in the room was very limited and the TV was not worth watching. Staff were friendly and helpful. The Club lounge was very good. The drinks and food were plentiful but perhaps a bit limited in variety.  We had two free items for laundry every day which was excellent.

The only fault I had was the little children racing around the large reception area, skidding on the highly polished floor.  Parents don't seem to discipline their children.  Beautiful breakfast with anything you could want.  Nice pool, however its a bit small, being in Singapore, everyone wants to use it and there is no room for swimming laps.

And it was also easy to reach several nearby MRT stations such as Bras Basah, City Hall, Esplanade, and Bugis, and several bus stops. For the room and services provided, both are great. The room was neat and clean, the bed was comfortable, the shower had above-your-head sprinkles, the shampoo and the soap were refreshing, and of course the in-dining was superb.

Strategic,"hotel is very strategically located to the nearest mall ( raffles mall), chijmes, and from there we can also walk to national gallery and other nice little shops.  Bed were a bit small , ordered a twin room but got a king instead ( twin size bed were just 1 meter width ) >> compared to other hotels with a 1.20 meter bed. it felt a bit tight. Swimming pool were pretty small considering that it is used for both (new and older ) building.  Coffee shop is always busy, and the cafe at the hotel lobby serves great desserts and drinks. Overall its ok, will stay there again.",40,Jun-17,Travelled with family,44,6,Carlton
Very nice hotel,"The Carlton Hotel was very nicely appointed and within walking distance of most attractions. When I say walking distance, I mean 20 to 30 minutes walk to places like Gardens by the Bay or China Town. Raffles is right next door.   The gym was quite large and well appointed for a hotel and the swimming pool was nice, but probably a bit small given the size of the hotel.   Alcoholic drinks were very expensive, but that's pervasive throughout Singapore. Think $12 for a beer.   Be warned - the hotel takes $100 from you account pre check in and this is not returned to your account for two weeks after check out. ",40,Jun-17,Travelled as a couple,53,19,Carlton
Disappointing staycation,"Disappointing staycation. Made reservations with family of four for 2 bedrooms. Our request is for a high floor. We got a low floor and our 2 bedrooms were facing the lift lobby. We could hear noisy hotel guests coming back at 12 midnight so we didn't sleep well. The air-con made a strange sound in both our bedrooms (when the AC's fan is left at low or medium level). We could hear the fan motor switched on and off on short intervals so again, we didn't sleep well. Mattress feels old, there is an indent in the middle. If management wish to find out more, please contact me.",20,Jul-17,Travelled with family,73,46,Carlton
As expected.,It is difficult for me to rate this hotel as they did nothing exceptional but did exactly what you expect from a hotel in this price class. Check in was smooth. Breakfast buffet was good and room was clean. Had some issues with the IPTV but that was fixed within 10 minutes. Hotel across the road from Raffles City thus within walking distance to the MRT station. Great location for shopping and sightseeing. Overall a great experience and I will return here in the future.,50,Jun-17,Travelled with family,56,60,Carlton
Lovely hotel but.... ,"I quite often stay at this hotel up to 8 times a year for the past three or so years and bring my colleagues with me (1-4 people at a time) staying from one night and up to one week per visit  but I have noticed every time I stay at the hotel my colleagues get upgraded to the club lounge while I never do get upgrade. I am a regular and book a premier room yet I never get upgraded. I asked why and apparently because I book via my company and via our Amex booking service, even though I pay on my own credit card. However the Carlton don't recognise or upgrade unless I book direct. So I question loyalty and I wonder why should I be loyal to this hotel or book colleagues in or even suggest they book at hotel. It is central, great rooms and people lovely but that's it..... no loyalty…",30,Jul-17,Travelled on business,115,138,Carlton
Excelllent again,"We arrived at the hotel around 8.00am after our flight from London and were feeling pretty well worn out. Reception said they would ready our room by 10.00am and would we like to avail ourselves of the Premier Lounge facilities while we waited, which we did.Sure enough at 10.00am our Premier Club Room was ready and we settled in for another very nice 3 night stay. The only negative on this visit was the lukewarm breakfast in the Premier Club Lounge on the last day, maybe the heaters didn't go on early enough. Anyway we will return!",50,Jun-17,Travelled as a couple,98,48,Carlton

Fantastic location - unbeatable. ,"Had a 5 night stay at the Carlton - the location is the best I've had in Singapore. Very close to City Hall MRT which is 2 stops from the Orchard Road. Also a very quick journey to Marina Bay and it's over the road from Raffles!   The hotel itself is okay. We were 'upgraded' to a premier room which I would decline in the future. This is because the basic rooms (which I booked in to) have been renovated, however the premier rooms have not and are older. Therefore if I were to stay again I would decline the upgrade. That said, the premier room was nice as it had a bath tub to relax in after a long day.  The front desk and housekeeping were very good - exchanging foreign currency and making up the room late in the day  Overall I'd definitely recommend the Carlton and would…",40,Jun-17,Travelled as a couple,54,43,Carlton

Poor clients´ service,"I have not yet been to the hotel but am already very dissapointed with the service received by the Reservations Officers with regards to an ""8 month"" advance reservation which should be breakfast inclusive according to their website.

FORGET THE CLUB LOUNGE,"The club lounge for our 17th level room was on the 4th level with covered windows and cold air-con. Food was of a dubious quality ... hot evening pastries recycled cold on the breakfast bar, dry bread for toasting, stale croissants. For an evening drink, only one style of red and white wine was offered.  It was not an inviting lounge  and not worth paying extra when there are so many other options in the near vicinity.  Also found it irritating to return to our room as late as 3.00 pm, to find it not made up.  Otherwise, the hotel is well located with the Raffles Hotel, Raffles shopping complex, and MRT directly opposite, the HOHO is a short walk, and Chijmes across the street has so many terrific restaurants.",30,Jun-17,Travelled as a couple,48,22,Carlton

Best location in Singapore. ,"If you are sight seeing in Singapore then this is your hotel! Literally walking to distance to all the main attractions Singapore has to offer: Bugis, Little Arab Town, Orchard Ave, Clarke Quay, Raffles etc. City Hall station is only a few mins walk away too. Perfect!  The rooms were nice, quite corporate and clinical but clean and sufficient nonetheless. Only thing I wish the rooms had was a bath. I rarely take one but all the walking from sight seeing had me craving a hot bath!  Shower has a lot of power to it, seems like a random thing to notice but when you come form a 5* hotel which dribbles out water in the shower.. A bit of extra water pressure is appreciated.  Don't bother going to Tuxedo Cafe downstairs for a coffee.. At $9 a pop it ain't worth it! ",50,Jun-17,Travelled as a couple,33,64,Carlton

There was a taxi rank outside the hotel which was reasonably priced, which we used to take us to the night safari.

Wedding lunch,"Went to a wedding lunch at Carlton Hotel located at Bras Brasah. The service is fantastic but the food quality is average only.   Carpark is quite narrow so if you drive there, you might want to be more careful going down the carpark ramp.

It has a nice view and ample seating room, their food selection could be improved though.

Every time I had to call for serviceman to tune the room temperature cooler or warmer. The ceiling light next to the window cannot turn on again after I turned off every time. As informed by the technician, there is something wrong with the contact equipment and he cannot complete the repair in a short time. I wonder why they give such a room to customer to stay.

Worst customer service I've ever received...,"The hotel lobby is pristine enough, and the room seemed freshly renovated--clean and organized. HOWEVER, their customer service is completely unacceptable. We realized on the first night we checked in we should have stayed anywhere but the Carlton.    One of the reasons why we stayed at the Carlton was that it offers free smart phones for guests, a feature that is prominently featured on the hotel website. We realized that the phone was missing from the room, so we called down to front desk to ask. No one picked up after 3 tries! After multiple attempts still no answer from the concierge or reception (which was a theme throughout our stay), I went down to speak directly with staff, who initially seemed surprised by the fact that there was no phone.

My room was on the 23rd floor and the views were just amazing. The bed was comfortable and there was everything you could need in the room. After check out I had a few hours to kill and was suggested to sit by the pool for a drink which was a great way to unwind.

The facilities in the room are good, a comfortable firm bed, good pillows, good sized towels and a fantastic rain shower and bath.  My main disappointment was the club lounge.  The layout doesn't lend to meeting fellow travellers, they do not provide bourbon in the bar and you cant take drinks or fruit back to your room.

Nice and comfy,"This hotel was perfect for our stop over in Singapore. It was a $25 taxi from the airport including luggage, and very convenient to the train station at Raffles and walkable to Bugis shopping centre during the day.  Staff were friendly and professional. The room was well equipped with its own smart phone that was free to use during our stay - helping us to navigate through the city without the need to buy a local sim card.  All the amenities were great. The only thing to mention is that the twin room has an ""open plan"" bathroom so if you're not travelling with family it can be slightly awarkward to come out of the shower cubicle to grab your towel and change discretely as there is no bathroom door in the room.  All up though, I would come back to stay again.",50,Apr-17,Travelled with friends,10,0,Carlton

No care for the fact the girls have nowehere to stay and have just had a long flight. No care for making them wait for over an hour at the reception desk. Completely humiliating them!

Great rain shower! USB sockets are really handy, kettle also.  Air Con was not very effective and I had to ask for a fan which was provided with no problem.  The $40 per night charge for use of exec lounge is worth it for the 2 pieces of laundry included each day as I was at the end of a long trip.

Weekend trip,"Stayed at Carlton Hotel for a weekend trip for Coldplay concert in Singapore. Chose the hotel based on the great location: it is within walking distance to 2 MRT stations : City Hall & Bras Basah for City Circle line. It is also directly in front of Raffles City Shopping Mall, which makes food options & shopping easy - if you don't have time to go to Orchad Road.  The check in process is quick & efficient, the concierge is helpful & kind, helping us with booking a taxi, the direction etc.  The room itself looks quite new with quite a spacious bathroom. All in all it is an excellent value for a great hotel, it's missing a point for a very simple tea & coffee pack in the room  and hot water takes a while to heat. However I will gladly return.",40,Apr-17,Travelled with friends,10,0,Carlton

Great place to stay in heart of Singapore,"We stayed a night at the Carlton Hotel as part of a recent 6 night visit to Singapore.  We were upgraded to a suite (#1401) which gave stunning views over the city at night.  It's location is great, close to Bras Basah MRT, with a nice pool.  Breakfast buffet was great, although coffee could do with some improvement :)  Only gripe was that our air conditioning kept clicking all night, switching on and off all night.  Was very distracting!  Other gripe was inconsiderate guests staying in adjoining rooms who banged their doors for about 15 mins around midnight as they ran across the hall from one room to the other.  Overall, I would recommend the Carlton.",40,Mar-17,Travelled as a couple,129,47,Carlton

On check in, we were instantly upgraded to a suite room, what a gokd way to start our holiday. When we entered, the room is spacious and spotless, the bed is wonderful. The breakfast was really good with so much to choose from and the staffs are really professional. The service is quick and i could not really find any fault from the services that we had until our check-out. From all the hotels that i've stayed in in Singapore, this is my favorite and I will definitely be coming back.",50,Feb-17,Travelled with friends,2,2,Carlton

Taxies are easy to get in front of hotel but also a walking distance to many shoppings, mrt-station etc. Lots of nice restaurants very near and legendary Raffels hotel and its giftshop is a neighbour :) Friendly staff but booking more nights couldn't be done cause they adwised us to go booking.com which was a bit aquard.

Your next best in City Hall,"This hotel is definitely worth your consideration as it is just a 3' min walk to Raffles City shopping mall and you don't pay the price of that in Fairmont or Swissotel which are both connected to the mall. And honestly you don't need that at all. For a decent sleep, close to the city, stones throw away from the mall and Mrt , I will definitely pick Carlton the next time im back in Singapore. Cafe mosaics breakfast however isn't as grand as that of fairmont' but who cares as my tummy prefers the local delights in Singapore!  Definitely consider Carlton for your next trip to Singapore!

Family Visit to Singapore,One of those hidden gems in Singapore if I may say. The price reasonable for a night and a very strategic place. Its near the Raffle City Mall and connected to the Green MRT City Hall so going to Orchard or Airport is relatively easy.   The concierge was very2 helpful. Check in was a breeze.

Unprofessional Staffs.,"I was checked in by a trainee. She execute the checked in very well. I was upgrade to premier suite. Upon check  in the room i realised the air con controller on the wall isnt working and the room wasnt cold so I decided to call the housekeeping for asst. 2 malay engineering came. Both were were relatively rude and the words they used wasnt polite. They seems to claim the room was cold and sounded sarcastic. The words they use among themselves such ""Sial"" which means jinx infront of me. I am utterly dissapointed with the service that was rendered by your hotel staffs.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"A fantastic hotel, centrally located, with a great club room on the 19th floor that served great breakfasts.  Our room was well appointed and spacious.  Only issue was we couldn't adjust the air conditioning on the wall control.  We needed to have maintenance adjust it four times and it was still too cold.  Didn't enjoy that too much. The staff in the club room were exceptional, except for one rude girl.  This did not detract from our stay though.

Upgrade to  premier club,This hotel is perfectly located and actually over looks the famous raffles hotel with the entrance to the raffles long bar only 30 seconds away. The hotel is large and we paid for a premier club room which limited access to our floor and also gave access to a dedicated lounge which was on the top floor and gave great views of the city and between 6 and 8 in the evening offered from alcohol and soft drinks as well as canapes but proved to be far more than nibbles.

The bar downstairs has really nice concoctions so if you have the mood for drinking, do try them.

Expect to get ripped off,This hotel takes $100 off your credit card for goodness knows what reason.  21 days after leaving I am still waiting for my card to be credited. 200 roomsx $100.00 over 20 days ? Why would the hotel  need a bank when they can rip off their guests in this manner. I will not be staying here again,10,Jan-17,Travelled on business,7,6,Carlton
Well located city centre hotel,Well located hotel . You can walk to a lot of the city centre points of interest or use the nearby metro station. Good breakfast . Big hotel so always seems busy . Nice pool on 5th floor area with bar/café.,40,Jan-17,Travelled as a couple,13,18,Carlton

Repeat visitor to this great hotel,"We,ve stayed here several years ago.We obviously liked and trusted the hotel and brand once again, we had a great experience  and noted some improvements which would be hard to do as they had such great service the last time.  This trip we stayed  in premium room on 18th, good view of raffles, Fairmont and raffles complex and some glimpses of the flyer and marina bay .  room was comfortable but a bit dark, as with any economic friendly hotel it seems.  breakfast was very good with wide variety.  excellent location for walking to sites or catching great city transit.  we used the concierge  several times and their services were great.

OK - nothing spectacular,Stayed for 3 nights on a business trip. Hotel is nice and the pool is so. Parts of the building look dated. Overall I was satisfied but didn't come away thinking it was good value when compared with other hotels in the area.,30,Mar-16,Travelled on business,6,2,Carlton
Worse experience ever....,"Unfortunately our experience at  Carlton Hotel Singapore was horrible.The rooms took over 6 hours to be ready even though they were booked in September 2016, and the only compensation they offered was a free drink that when we went to use the cafe informed us was not valid. The hotel housekeeping staff totally disregarded that there was a roll-a-way bed in one of  the rooms, so every day we had to ask for linen and water for three people. The roll-a-way was so basic and uncomfortable for my 13 year old son that an airbed would have been better that we took over ourselves. Then on checking out there was a discrepancy with the bill as I had booked through an agent for the roll-a-way, so I was forced to pay for the horrid service again, bad bed again. Management has disregarded my…",10,Dec-16,Travelled with family,3,2,Carlton
Simply the best! 👍🏼,"I checked in at this hotel on Sunday, 22 Jan 2017, at 1 pm. The front desk officer, Mr Muhammad Fausian (I hope I spell his name right) was the one who assisted me. He is the best! Very friendly, warm and managed to get the specific room that we want. He is one of the best front officers that I have ever encountered so far. He always smile and very sincere, he upgraded our room and last but not least, he was soooo polite! If one of the Carlton Hotel managers read my review, you should consider him for a promotion! I love this hotel! The pool is good. The location is perfect and if you ask me will I stay in this hotel again, my answer will be YES! We did not try the food though so I cannot give any review for that. The house keeper, I forget to ask his name, the one who helped us…",50,Jan-17,Travelled with family,122,60,Carlton
Best Ever,"I have stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. Very comfortable, quiet and high standard. Gym and pool area very nice. Right in the city with easy access to pubs,  restaurants, shopping and attraction also Sentosa Island (beach). Hotel gives you mobile phone on which you can use internet for free, sat nav and you can call some countries free of charge. Food was nice and staff was great. My favourite place so far.",50,Dec-16,Travelled on business,75,28,Carlton
Good hotel,"This hotel is very modern and clean and in a great location. Our room was very small and cramped, there wasn't really anywhere to fit all of our luggage, so we were not happy about that. Apparently it was an upgrade to what we had originally booked because there were no more king rooms available in our original grade booking. If this was an upgrade I can only imagine what I our original room was supposed to be like. We didn't eat at the restaurant at this hotel but I heard it's very good. The location can't be beat, lots of shopping and public transportation close by. Overall, we were happy with our stay.",40,Jan-17,Travelled as a couple,90,50,Carlton
"Good Hotel, with great location","I have been staying here quite frequently over the past year. Accumulating around 25 days or so. The staff is in general helpful and friendly. Especially the bar staff, which unfortunately is being replaced by external vendor, were very nice and attentive.  Good location close to shopping, bar and eating places. Free mobile for use (battery life is low, so only power when needed) Nice rooms and great views. Great Gym facility. One of the best I have found at any hotel Good breakfast buffet, with big selection, however no change in menu in +1 year. Dinner/Room service food, I found okay, but of no particular good quality. Pricing of rooms are okay/good, but services/buffets are very pricey. Attentive and open for feedback management. Staff helpfulness and service level depends on…",40,Jan-17,Travelled on business,53,27,Carlton
"Very enjoyable stay, Great location",We had a very enjoyable stay at the Carlton Hotel.   The bed was very comfortable and the location is excellent... a short walk to the MRT.   Very good value as well considering the cost.  We stayed in the premier room so got the additional benefit of free soft drinks and happy hour.,50,Dec-16,Travelled as a couple,57,33,Carlton
Lovely sleep,"stayed here twice while on a 3 week holiday very nice service lovely rooms both times we stayed great view from room 1473, the rooms were very clean and provided you with every thing you might need.

Great Value For Money,"This hotel is centrally placed,close to Raffles and Bugis St. The rooms clean,large and with all aminities. It even has a swimming pool ( not in the room ). The staff are efficient and accommodating. This is a good choice if you want a clean, good value no frills hotel. It is used by many airlines.",50,Jan-17,Travelled as a couple,30,45,Carlton

Excellent!,"Cannot praise this hotel enough. Outstanding customer service all round. Nothing was a problem. Rooms are spotless and comfortable. This hotel is very convenient for Raffles hotel, Raffles mall and Chijmes restaurant outlet. Will definitely be staying here again.  ",50,Jan-17,Travelled as a couple,83,84,Carlton
Great location,"We loved the location of this hotel, across the road from the raffles hotel, raffles city s/c and 10 minute walk to the marina. Also only 5 mins to MRT located in raffles city s/c. We received a free upgrade to the club floor and the staff were very friendly, breakfast was nice but maybe the hot food could be hotter. This hotel offers free wifi plus free iphone for use around Singapore and free international calls to certain countries ie Australia, U.K. etc we would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again.",40,Jan-17,Travelled as a couple,4,0,Carlton
"Great hotel, excellent location.","We stayed 9 nights at the Carlton Hotel Singapore. It exceeded our expectations and made our trip memorable. We had a great view on the 13th floor towards the Raffles hotel next door and the Marina Bay. The room was roomy, the bed was very good and the service was fine. The location is excellent: it's a short way from practically everything. And by taxi you can get around quickly and affordably.",50,Jan-17,Travelled as a couple,112,62,Carlton
Perfect location for a city trip,"I did really like my 3 nights stay at the Carlton Hotel Singapore. When I arrived early in the morning after a long flight, the room was just ready for check-in. Nice room, very modern, very clean and a fresh smell. The reception staff was very friendly and helpful, the pool was also very nice. There are two different towers, and older and a newer one. I stayed at the new tower. I totally would recommend this hotel to a friend!",50,Feb-16,Travelled solo,269,108,Carlton
Excellent hotel with one caveat...,"A friend and I stayed at this Carlton for a long weekend recently.  The location is very good as it is in between two subway stations (City Hall and Bras Basah) as well as easy walking distance to Orchard Road, etc.  The breakfast buffet is phenomenal-definitely include this with your hotel package if possible.  Customer service was spot on as well as housekeeping.  The pool area is very nice.  My only negative would be that there is now no hotel bar.  Apparently they closed down ""Gravitas"" but I don't believe there are plans for another bar.  Keep this in mind if this is important to your hotel stay.  Overall, nice stay at a mid priced hotel.

very nice establishment,"Across the road from Raffles, this hotel is a very classy place. Especially love the free smartphone that you can take around singapore during your stay that gives you free internet and international calls. Very handy with travel deals uploaded onto phone. Only downside is lack of variety of TV channels for when your unwinding at night. The rooms themselves are excellent ",40,Oct-16,Travelled as a couple,35337,2041,Carlton
Would thorough recommend ,"My first time staying at the Carlton and I would definitely return. My room was refurbished with all I could need, friendly staff and very handy location. Raffles Shopping City (and Raffles itself) is just across the road with all sorts of good and shopping and a handy supermarket. Plus Chjimes nearby which is definitely worth a look behind the walls- it was beautiful. The Carlton also had great changing facilities after checking out if you need them after collecting your bags.",40,Jan-17,Travelled on business,5,0,Carlton

Had better service from motels. Bitter experience,"Booked and currently staying at this place. Business trip. Booked for a month and still no complimentary breakfast, no laundry. Broken shower. Requested reception for an upgrade and didn't mind paying extra. They responded they can Upgrade only the room type but cannot include breakfast and laundry. Quite rude responses as well. Not coming back and will spread the word.",10,Jan-17,Travelled on business,1,6,Carlton
A great place to stay and will return.,"Great Hotel. Concierge are superb. Nicely appointed rooms and housekeeping are like ninjas - the rooms were always tidied up regardless of when we disappeared! Excellent location and close to Raffles, Raffles City Marketplace, Bugis Junction etc. A couple of things to be wary of though 1. Drinks prices are absurd - I expect to pay a premium but $11 + 3% service charge + 7% GST for a Coke is ridiculous. 2. Expect to leave a deposit of $50 per night as security - not a biggy but could compromise those managing a card budget. But these are minor points - it's an excellent Hotel with excellent people working it.",50,Jan-17,Travelled with family,32,22,Carlton
