Fantastic service!,"A superb ambience to end off a Sunday. The Landing Point’s afternoon tea menu never fails to surprise! Everything is so good, from its good to its service. A big thank you to Ms Lotha (hopefully we spelled it correctly) who checks in with us (and other guests) regularly to attend to our needs! Definitely coming back for more!",50,Oct-22,Travelled as a couple,5,0,Fullerton
Very high quality hotel,"Stunning hotel, backed up by outstanding service. The construction and interior design of the Fullerton Bay make it a unique place to stay. The marina location is as central as it gets and the view across the water to MBS is a great one. We stayed in a third floor corner room, which was high spec and with views of the water on two sides. The rooftop pool is a special area for spending time in central Singapore. The Lantern bar is a great vantage point for evening drinks and watching the light show. The hotel feels more relaxed and less touristy than MBS (which works at MBS, not a slight on that experience- certainly also worth checking out). We stayed with our twenty two month old daughter for two nights. Service was exceptionally good and welcoming, though perhaps the vibe is better suited to families at Shangri-La. Two nights at the end of our trip were memorable and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Alvin the butler and Indra on reception were particularly helpful, nothing was too much trouble- very welcome when travelling with a toddler and much appreciated. All their colleagues were also very kind. Perhaps best recommended for couples who want a more chilled, but high-end, boutique experience. Five star review an easy decision.…",50,Aug-22,Travelled with family,12,0,Fullerton

What you pay is what you get,"Went there for a staycation to celebrate my birthday. The service starts from entrance all the way to the check-in counter - being escorted throughout and also engaged in some small talks. Service was absolutely top notch. Upon checking in to the room, it was relatively big and clean. The room came with Bose Bluetooth speaker and TV with good selection of cable channels. There's also a small balcony with excellent view where you could chill and admire the scenery. Though the high price tag, I believe that it's truly one of a kind experience. Will definitely return again. ",50,Nov-21,Travelled as a couple,9,7,Fullerton

The Best Hotel in Singapore,"Everything about my experience at The Fullerton was incredible.

I would highly recommend anyone to stay at this hotel.",50,Sep-22,Travelled solo,31,55,Fullerton
Worst bar in Singapore or anywhere to be honest,"I don’t think I have been to a more pretentious entitled place in my life , from the 20 somethings pushing past us to get into the lift to the duff duff music on entry.Please wait to be given a standing only spot at 10.30 pm and then take 25 mins to get an overpriced cocktail. Get a table then wait 30 mins to get a second drink which actually never came  , how long does it take to pour a beer? The only reason that it get 1 star is due to the view and the air conditioned toilets very disappointing experience would not recommend at all .",10,Sep-22,Travelled as a couple,33,19,Fullerton

Lantern Bar fantastic on two days,"We had a superb evening in the Lantern bar.  Greeted by Alvin in the lobby and personally taken up before the bar was even open, it seemed nothing was too much trouble.  The staff went to the effort of bringing up cake from downstairs to go with our tea - even though it was not normally served.  Germa then managed to find a table for us the next evening to watch the light show.  We were greeted like old friends firstly by Alvin, then Germa and Anna when we were again escorted up to the Lantern.  We enjoyed a marvellous meal and were looked after for the evening by Julius.  A perfect location on the bay, along with exemplary service.  Cannot praise this beautiful hotel highly enough.",50,Sep-22,Undisclosed,1,0,Fullerton

Afternoon Tea at Fullerton,"We came for afternoon tea for birthday celebration. Service was excellent. Lotha who served us was attentive and checked in with us a couple of times.

Excellent service and beautiful view from room,"The hotel is beautiful and the room was clean and bright, with an incredible view. But it was the exceptional service provided that made our stay extremely pleasant and comfortable.  Every staff member with whom we came in contact with was polite and professional. However, there are five staff members that were so impressive in their service that we will definitely return to the hotel again.  Every morning, we were greeted so warmly by Ms. Lotha Dimaano at La Brasserie. She was extremely attentive and kind, and always has a smile on her face when speaking to us. She is truly exceptional.

Disappointing and not up to standard,Always used to look forward to and enjoy my stays at the Fullerton Bay Hotel.  Despite the perfect location for Singapore the Fullerton team are not providing 5 star service.  Teamwork looks poor across the various teams be that the kitchen and front office service teams are not working together.  Service is slow and disjointed.  Teams are trying but it looks like there is a gap in senior management oversight.  After years of being a massive fan of the Fullerton Bay I will not be staying there again and will not be recommending it to friends and family.  Simply put the gap between the price you pay and the service you get are too far apart.,10,Aug-22,Travelled on business,2,0,Fullerton

Best hotel in Singapore,"This is our favorite hotel in Singapore. We go often and we have had a chance to try several of the top hotels. This is by far the best one. The location is slightly off so you always need a car. But if you are staying here, you probably have a car waiting for you anyway. We love the rooms and the rooftop pool. The food at the cafe for breakfast is delicious too. We highly recommend Fullerton Bay and please do not confuse it with Fullerton Hotel, which is the post office hotel.

Best trip to Singapore May 2022,"5 stars  all over, location, service, food and accommodations. Unforgettable family trip. Although flights were long and luggage missed the connecting flight and arrived 2 days later, it was worth it. Enjoyed some Michelin star restaurants plus the nightly light shows at the Marina. Changi airport is very clean and efficient. VAT refunds were efficient. There are no priority ques for business class travelers but there was no need. The facial recognition check in was very fast. Security check is prior to boarding the flight so one must allow sufficient time to board. Singapore should be on everyone's bucket list or must visit list. Caters to all ages and tastes.

Back again,"Back again at this fantastic hotel. We were able to check in fairly early which was appreciated, beautiful rooms and bathrooms and a nice balcony to enjoy. The beds are comfortable with nice bedding. The service is mostly very good, but during breakfast it was at times not so good, things were forgotten, wrong meals delivered and having to wait for a long time to be served. What really disappointed us was that there was no restaurant service by the pool, The Lantern did not open until 5 PM, this was not OK, meaning no drinks or food beeing served until late afternoon. Hope the opening hours will change eventually. At night a great place to be serving drinks with a smile Had a nice afternoon tea our last day.

Very good experience; but needs some improvements to be at the top,"The experience overall was very good. The location is pretty much perfect, also the service in general is excellent, so is the wow effect when you arrive. So why not a five then? First, having stayed in manny similar hotels elsewhere in Asia, I was surprised by the narrow options for breakfast (which is usually one key feature of many high end hotels in the region), maybe it is was due to Covid restrictions, but I was quite surprised to see that there were only a few a la carte options, rather than the usual massive spread of different buffet and a la carte alternatives. My second negative comment is regarding the fitness facilities. The gym is basically two treadmills and a few weights cramped on a 30m2 space…if there more than two people at the same time you are bumping into…",40,Apr-22,Travelled with family,16,24,Fullerton

Not an issue, mistakes happen, until the front desk clerk tried to insist she take the room once luggage had been removed.."" The room was cleaned, it is fine"" ...as in cleaned before someone else put their luggage in it and had access. Other than that, the hotel was not really fully open. The rooftop restaurant was closed until 5 pm, and other outlets were usually full, or in the case of The Brasserie, horrible. Again, staff was overall unhelpful and aloof.",20,May-22,Undisclosed,34,78,Fullerton

Loved the mirrors everywhere in the room! The view was fantastic!  Service from hotel was excellent. Breakfast was sumptuous and delicious.

Amazing second stay at The Fullerton Bay Hotel,"We recently stayed at The Fullerton Bay Hotel, for the second time in 4 months. This time, we had another amazing stay there too!

However, I did not inform them beforehand, and when I called FBH on the morning of our new check in dates, they informed me that my booking had remained in their original dates. I got a shock. I immediately explained my situation and they said that they would contact their Reservations Team to see if I could get a room on that day.

Bath tub stopper damaged so the water can’t be drained after you have your soak.  and house keeping told me this is common in a few rooms.( so they don’t really give a Hoot on maintaining )  Food is over price …   $15 for four pieces of thin slices of satay and five cubes of rice which they masquerade as ketupat .  drinks price reasonably though .

Whilst certainly not inexpensive, the location, views, traveller reviews and rooftop pool ticked a lot of boxes for us as a family  One thing I did do before booking was reach out to the hotel directly to understand if there were any (Covid-related) time restrictions on access to the pool.

2 Star Service but Pay 5 Star,"1. When I was checking in, my husband and young child were behind me.

I stepped on a piece of used plaster with a spot of dried up blood on the carpet. Called the GM who returned my call in 7 minutes, but OMG, the hotel manager took 2 hours before we changed room. First she wanted to see for herself, then she said will clean the room, to which I said I'm not comfortable, so she said will move us to a room on same floor, after waiting, she called and said its a room on 1st floor, then 30mins later she called and said its a room on same floor and personally escorted us there. 3.

The concierge was kind of weird about it and said that since the hotel provides international outlets that was the best we ought to be able to hope for and that it was our responsibility to bring out own plug heads.

Be careful of extra charges,"Be careful if you are seeking to upgrade your rooms, I was told by reservation officer the price I paid in extra for an extra night with an upgrade of room are all inclusive. However upon checkout, did I realise I had to pay and no the price wasn't that, it came as a rude bill shock and unpleasant experience.  La Brasserie wasn't much of a good dining experience either, preferential treatment to other guests.  Have stayed in so many hotels in SG, nice hotel but experience is one of the worst.",20,Dec-21,Undisclosed,14,7,Fullerton

The best birthday staycation ever!,It was our first time staying at FBH and I must say that I am very impressed with its customer service from the time we did our bookings right up to the food options (we are a Muslim family with young kids and older parents) we had at the Cafe.

Package,"We booked a family package which has 1 of the benefits stated "" Complimentary extra bed"" but in the end we did not get one though I thought I reserve quite early.  Hence, I would like to comment that if the hotel decide to rollout such package, it should allow all customer who book the package to be able to get the extra bed. Else it defeat the purpose of paying for such package.  And also to take into consideration for kids under 12, eg 11 will be difficult to share bed.",30,Dec-21,Undisclosed,1,0,Fullerton

Top Class with Some Blemishes,"It's apparent that The Fullerton Bay strives to deliver excellence in all facets of the guest's experience. While I did see that quite often, I also dealt with some incidences that dampened the enjoyment of our stay. The first was during check-in when the guest who came after us was serviced first despite us standing in front of the counter for a few minutes, while he just came straight from the door. Secondly, the light would not turn on when I had to use the bathroom at 6am. Instead, an eye-searing emergency light flashed for minutes as a technician was trying to fix it. By the time the problem was resolved, it had almost been an hour and my jet lag was exacerbated since I arrived from an 18-hour flight from Los Angeles just the day prior.  It wouldn't be fair to not mention…",30,Dec-21,Undisclosed,1,0,Fullerton

Lovely hotel for first business trip in many months,"I am over the moon about my stay at the Fullerton Bay.  I had a normal room, but it was large, well lit, and had a peaceful balcony overlooking customs house.  Sitting on the sofa on the balcony made all the difference.  Of course, everything else about the hotel, the service, etc is wonderful.   My only complaint is about the breakfast (boring, small portions, cheap ingredients) and the gym (tiny!  only two treadmills, of which one is blocked off due to covid), one bike and one elliptical.  One pulley weight stack, but falling very short of the five star standard.  I loved that the Fullerton Bay is a small hotel, but this was not good.   By contrast the swimming pool saved the day.

Afternoon High Tea,"5 stars!  We were half an hour too early for the high tea to commence. However, instead of asking us to wait elsewhere and come back later, Maria offered us a table along the walkway to sit while waiting. We saw that there were table seatings closer to the glass window with a view, so we enquired if we could get the seats there. Unfortunately, as we made the booking late, she informed that it was fully booked but would make the arrangements if there was a cancellation. Shortly after, she came back to inform us that there was indeed a window table available for us. We were very pleased that she took action immediately to see if she could help us secure a window seating instead of brushing our request off.  Once we were seated, Maria also offered to get us glasses of water so that…",50,Sep-21,Travelled with friends,1,0,Fullerton

My brother and I are writing this on behalf of our parents (we are nine year old twins),"My family went to the Fullerton Bay hotel for my Mom's birthday. It was one of the best hotels we have been to.  Here are a few reasons why:      First,  is that we got free ice cream ( which we loved ) with an ice cream ID/Pass that we could use ever day.  Another reason why we loved this hotel is our room and the hotel's pool was amazing.  Last but not least the hotel people were very welcoming. One example is someone opened the door for us . This was a amazing hotel because firstly we got free ice cream (and a cake for my mom's bday), second of all  we loved the amazing room and the pool, and finally the people are amazing.

Wonderful staycation (and absolutely spoilt by the attentive staff),"Celebrating a friend's birthday, we booked a 3 day staycation over the long weekend, having stayed and dined here several times before, and I must what sets this place apart is the service standards by all the staff.  At the breakfast venue (La Brasserie) three days in a row, we was totally spoilt by the ever attentive staff who dropped by every few minutes to check if I wanted to try something else from the menu, or if I needed extra drinks, sauces or condiments. To be honest, I felt slightly embarrassed by the attention, which you probably might not even get in a Michelin star restaurant.

"An incredible hotel, with impeccable decor and service","This is my second visit to Fullerton Bay Hotel. I honestly wouldn't have chanced upon this hotel if not for COVID. The search for a staycation landed me at this beautiful hotel.  I stayed over during a semi lock down in Singapore. There was a promotion, and the hotel was selling with a complimentary night stay. It was a hard to resist offer.  Took the offer, and stayed two nights with the Premier Bay View Room (I had an upgrade). The view was fantastic. The sounds of lapping water against the hotel was extremely therapeutic. I could sit hours at the balcony and enjoy the view with the constant cool breeze.   The decor is impressive. Modern and yet classic. Service was fabulous.   Breakfast was served in the room. See picture. It is simply fabulous and out of this country.   I…",50,May-21,Undisclosed,33,3,Fullerton

Terrible experience,"Wonder why this hotel is rated so high. First of all, Fullerton Bay and Fullerton has not much difference. My husband and I stayed both and we don’t see any special things which makes Fullerton Bay even though the price of stay is double. ( Didn’t get Bay view room) Second, the duty manager who assisted me and my husband was unprofessional . Had issues upon check out on the bill and the way he handle the issue made us very disappointed. Even though the email from the hotel clearly indicates that dining credit can be used at TOWN restaurants, the hotel has to investigate if they want to approve it or not. Not only we paid that upon the checkout but also they don’t show sincerity at all to solve the issue.  WE call them to give us updates. NOT THEM.  5 star?

Bayfront luxury oasis,"The Fullerton Bay hotel has a couple of fantastic things going for it. First, being fairly new, it has all the nice modern fittings that sets it apart from other hotels in its class (and there aren’t many operating at this upper echelon of luxury anyway, and they are mostly older and dated). Second, and more importantly, it has an exclusive, unrivalled location on the bayfront promenade. Other hotels in the area can claim to have a bay view, but only the Fullerton Bay can boast to be right at the bayfront, over the water in fact.   Given this, it is absolutely incumbent that you minimally book a bay view room to fully enjoy the hotel’s unique appeal (yes, the premium over the entry rooms is totally worth it; it will make perfect sense every time you enter the room).

Pleasurable experience at the La Brasserie,"Excellent service by Kumar and Vijay. Love the ambiance and food.  The breads served along with the rillette was fantastic, the escargots with garlic bread was good but I would definitely  recommend the prawns with chorizo.  Soups were great but could have much more depth of flavour to the mushrooms. The onion soup was spot on and I enjoyed it  I had the beef cheek for my main course and I would prefer to have it served with sauce, nonetheless the meat was perfectly done. The lamb tasted wonderful with such succulent meat with aromatic herbs.  Dessert was satisfying, simple but never compromising on flavour  the apple desser with yuzu sorbet brightened my heavy meal after the mains.

Fantastic Birthday Weekend!,"It was such an awesome choice to pick this hotel for my husband’s birthday celebration from the 20th to the 22nd of March.  It was walking distance to MBS, and it was such a scenic walk too!  The room gave an aura of old charm, and the balcony opens up to a breathtaking view, be it day or night. We were just content to sit at the balcony and listening to the sound of the water. There were all the amneties that we needed, and the toilet were clean, big and spacious. Nothing to complain about at all.  (Our room were Bay View)  As per the norm, you have to book a slot at the pool, at the gym etc. The pool was located nicely at the roof, and again, the view was amazing.

EXCELLENT SERVICE BY KUMAR,"It was a lovely evening, coupled with a splendid view of the applauded CBD of our tiny red dot. It started with that, but that's just the start of it. We were pleasantly greeted by Kumar who made the entire evening a wonderful experience and we had the privilege to be attended by him for the rest of the evening. The food was aesthetically pleasing, I would like to highlight the prawns with chorizo and the halibut, tho it needed a dash of salt and pepper. I'm not so much of a dessert person but the Apple dessert did bring about a much-needed slight sugar rush for the evening. Would recommend, definitely. Look for Kumar, thank me later!",40,Mar-21,Travelled as a couple,5,0,Fullerton
Great customer service,"Kumar was excellent, always on the lookout if we needed any service and great people skills engaging with us.

Quite disappointed ,"We got there almost 3pm and stated our room was not ready yet and not sure what specific time the room will be ready, i’m just shocked that one of the well know 5star hotel in SG would have something like this, we checked-in earlier last month in Fullerton Hotel the service was impeccable cannot help to compare with one another. I believed roughly 1 1/2 hour they informed us our room was ready. I must mention also while waiting for the room to be ready they took us to the Lantern bar to have refreshments which is nice gestures of them and the staff were very professional also on how they handle things.

"Lovely service, well-prepared food","My wife and I had a staycation at Fullerton Bay Hotel, and decided to have dinner at La Brasserie. The food was very well “designed” - the Wagyu beef tartare was excellent, because the richness of the beef was balanced with the perfect amount of mustard, a mint mayonnaise, and given flair with caviar and shaved truffles. Definitely a must try. We also had the catch of the day, and the champignon and truffle soup; which were all great too. Our dessert was a dark chocolate “dome”, which was very rich and isn’t for the faint hearted. The real stars of the night were our servers, Mr Kumar and Ms Sunny.

Excellent Fine Dining and Service,"We had a delightful time dining at La Brasserie for my birthday! We were initially enticed to try them out by the mix of delectable French cuisine and top quality wine featured on their website - and they did not disappoint! In fact, I might go as far as to say that the pictures on the website don’t do their food or the elegance of the restaurant enough justice. Our food was delicious from start to finish, emphasising traditional French dishes - such as escargot, onion soup and Confit de Canard, which we couldn’t get enough of. If you are as much a soup addict as I am, I highly recommend trying both the traditional onion and the champignon and truffle.

What a great spot to do some touristy stuff especially, visiting Merlion.   Kudos to the Fullerton Bay Hotel team! Just superb for everything.  ",50,Nov-20,Travelled with family,107,20,Fullerton
Birthday Weekend,"We were fortunate to stay in the Robinson Suite with incredible views of Marina Bay, I doubt there is a better hotel room in the city!  The front office team seemed to be understaffed during our stay as we faced issues with checkin (there was nobody at checkin) and on the Sunday despite the pool being open for hours there was nobody there initially (no towels or able to order drinks etc) a quick call to reception and this was resolved for the 18+ people at the pool.  The F&B team during brunch and dinner canapés were very attentive and highly recommended experiences. ",30,Nov-20,Travelled as a couple,6,3,Fullerton
Comfy stay,My wife and I had a comfortable and memorable stay at Fullerton Bay. The staff were attentive and the hotel is nestled at the bay with an amazing view of the harbour. Mr Asenth was one of staff that gave us commendable service and made us feel at home. Thank you Mr Asenth and the staff of Fullerton Bay.

Great place to have your wedding!,I was at the hotel to attend and help out at my frienods' wedding. The venue and overall service was great. The outdoor venue where the solemnisation took place overlook the Barrage and MBS. The indoor venue was spacious and well decorated. Food was individually plated and tasted and look great. We were helped by manager of the day Nicholas who was great with tips and advice when needed. These are special times but im glad the whole went smoothly.,50,Nov-20,Travelled with friends,51,53,Fullerton

High Tea,"It was our first time visiting the Landing Point for their high tea and we were there to celebrate our Anniversary. Both the food, service and view (directly facing MBS) was nothing short of excellent- Shout out to the team (Daniel, Idrus, Arianne) for taking care of us during the period. The staff was very attentive and prompt to our needs and requests. They also took note of our anniversary and present us with a complimentary cake and photo to remember the occasion of which was a nice touch. Highlight of the high tea was the Beef Rendang Pot Pie (which was refillable) and Lychee Panacotta. 10/10 will come again.",50,Nov-20,Travelled as a couple,28,8,Fullerton
