Couples looking to stay,"Overall our stay was lovely. The hotel was immaculate and the spread at breakfast was amazing. The pool was also very nice with a great pool side bar. Downsides, however was that we felt the hotel was catered more towards families with children than for couples like us trying to enjoy a break. Last orders at the bar were 9:30pm with the bar completely closing at 10:30pm, often of an evening we wanted to enjoy a drink after we got back from dinner but we couldn't do this. There is also no MRT station nearby which meant we were forced to get taxis everywhere or walk out in the heat ( there was no path out of the hotel).  We also ordered more towels via the in room concierge ( they only gave two small towels per room) and these never arrived.",40,Oct-22,Travelled as a couple,2,0,ShangriLa
Fantastic stay in a great hotel with great staff,"We had a short stay at the Shangri-la on our way to Vietnam but it beca e the highlight of our trip. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we received amazing service. The people who stood out were Yana on reception and Rajagopal, the  cheif concierge.  Yang went to great effort to find us a room when we checked in early. My wife is disabled and needed a rest but our room wouldn't be ready for some time. Yana negotiated a beautiful upgrade for us a d did everything possible during our stay to make is comfortable for us, especially my wife. Rajagopal was an enormous helper every day, giving advice, booking excursions, finding taxis and much more. I think he had the biggest impact on our stay. Our room was beautifully presented and well maintained.   It was my birthday and we were surprised to find a small birthday cake and card in our room. While we were staying at the hotel they also hosted an enormous international security conference that had a massive impact on the hotel, the staff, guests and the whole city, but staff did as much as they could to minimise impact on other guests.  Make no mistake, this is an expensive hotel, but they provide great service and great rooms. The food is excellent and the environment lovely. …",50,Jun-22,Travelled as a couple,141,63,ShangriLa
Enjoyable stay!,"Shangri-La Singapore has always maintained high standards, and I have to make a special commendation for Siva Sharmah, who has always been extremely proactive, helpful, obliging, with a great customer care attitude.",40,Sep-22,Travelled on business,5,3,ShangriLa
Family Staycation,"Mia Tan, Director of Family Experience, was such a great help letting our children feel so welcome at Shangri-La. The Splash water playground was super fun and the kids goodie bag was such a pleasant surprise when we checked in.  The staff-members at Buds children playground were friendly and Chef Stef at Bake made such a memorable experience for the kids! Thanks so much! We will definitely be back again.",50,Oct-22,Travelled with family,4,0,ShangriLa
Resting on Laurels …….I will not be back,"I visited around ten years ago and the standards of this fine company have dropped at this location. Having been in the hotel business for over 20 years the British GM has lots of work to do……… Observations on this trip to see the Grand Prix.  It seemed to be a surprise to this hotel that the largest event in the City meant it was full! One of the reasons for booking is the regular shuttle to Orchard road for the MRT. However as occupancy has been low they kept the shuttle at only 4 times in the middle of the day. This is critical when competing against all of the many fine Marina Bay properties  Worse was to follow at Breakfast in The Line…….Huge full hotel and guess how many on duty at the egg station…..ONE Chef……I discussed this with him and another colleague was away on holiday ,over the busiest time the hotel has seen in 3 years ! Amazed in a 5 star hotel no bar open after midnight on arriving back from the city …a lost revenue opportunity indeed. Saturday night there was not a single staff member anywhere to be seen including the front desk when we got back! The Pool area is nice….however the Jacuzzi is broken and confirmed to me it had been for sometime by a staff member on duty at the pool…….not very Shangri- La…..I expect better.  Anytime we had issues,there is obviously zero empowerment for the team as all they do is apologise but do nothing ….when my Bill was wrong in checkout ….3 people had to review it before amending. I will not be back on my next trip.…",30,Oct-22,Travelled with family,58,59,ShangriLa
Old school hotel comfort in a garden setting,"I had last stayed at the Shangri - La Hotel  back in 1987 in the Garden Wing and had a wonderful time.  For this brief stay on my way home from Europe I booked a room in the Tower Wing which proved to be just tight, with its most welcome and comfortable bed.   The staff are lovely and the garden setting is a big plus in a city that has grown so much.   I would definitely stay at the Shangri - La again …",50,Sep-22,Travelled solo,148,41,ShangriLa
Pleasant stay,"Husband and I booked this hotel as it seemed reasonably priced in comparison to other 5 star hotels in Singapore. We enjoyed our stay here, ample space in bedroom and bathroom in the tower wing deluxe room. The breakfast buffet was also the best out of the 5 hotels we stayed in during our time in Asia.",40,Sep-22,Travelled as a couple,30,0,ShangriLa
Outstanding,"We have just spent 12 days at the Shangri-La, and were lucky enough to have a room upgrade from the garden wing to the Valley Wing.  Wow, the room was large and fitted out in luxury.  All the staff were very polite, professional and welcoming.   The room upgrade is actually as it says, you don't get the canapés, cocktails etc, only the room, but it is so much better its worth it.  So Thank you to the Shangri-La for upgrading us on our retirement celebration. The pool is stunning, with lush vegetation all round, colourful birds and beautiful view's.  One slight downfall was the amount of young children running around and screaming whilst in the water, sadly parents not being considerate to other guests, not the hotels fault. We didn't eat in the restaurants due to our financial situation, but taxi's to Orchard Road and hawker centres were cheap and plentiful. This has been the nicest hotel we have stayed at in regards to luxury, whereas the Pan Pacific/Mandarin Oriental are more business orientated. The internal of the whole complex is opulent and all the small touches make it so special, admittedly we were in the Valley wing.  The gardens are stunning. We can highly recommend this hotel, rates are very competitive, but eating in is on the high side (we'll for us they are). Thank you Shangri-La, you certainly made our holiday special and thank you Sally for looking after us in the Summit Room. We will certainly be recommending you to friends and hopefully will return in the few years.…",50,Sep-22,Travelled as a couple,12,23,ShangriLa

Such beautiful elegance.,"We were having the trip of a lifetime, and Shangri-la did not disappoint. The garden hotel certainly lives up to its name - fabulous extensive gardens planted with palms, orchids and lush borders. Our room in the Garden Wing partly overlooked the massive pool, and partly the gardens. The facilities and service are second to none and there are many in-house eating options. The staff are unfailingly courteous and nothing is too much trouble for them. I could go on with well deserved superlatives, but would just like to mention the Concierge service. Mr Rajagopal Rajkumar and his team were magnificent in booking us some trips. Any issues with the tour company were efficiently ironed out and as a result we enjoyed several wonderful day trips. Their desk was always manned by pleasant smiley faces, albeit masked, and we were very grateful for their presence. Thank you to all at Shangri-la Singapore, we will not forget you.…",50,Sep-22,Travelled as a couple,53,28,ShangriLa
Very good hotel in a nice area of Singapore away from the centre,"Excellent hotel as you would expect from this chain. Very modern throughout with good staff and facilities in the room.

Faultless,"We had a faultless (near enough) stay at the Valley Wing. We like the Shangri La brand and this is one of their jewels in the crown. First class service throughout which really makes the place. Everything in the valley wing is handled with gracious efficiency and courtesy. Despite the elegant surroundings, children are made to feel welcome. We can't wait to return. Wish we could thank everyone in the Valley wing, but special mention to Valley wing Director Aris, Amin and Peggy and the conductor of orchestra John Rice!",50,Aug-22,Undisclosed,22,49,ShangriLa
Nice hotel for weekend hide-away,"Just spent a few days for a weekend hide-away. I am a Marriot Bonvoy elite and I am not even in Shangri la circle, so my expectation was not high when I checked in. To my surprise, I was impressed by the nice deluxe room, great hospitality and service received. They even delivered a birthday cake with a warming card to go with it, reaching me finally through multiple efforts. Thanks Yana! Try the table by the pool. With wine and great food from the Italian restaurant, everything is just perfect! Will definitely be back once in a while.",50,Sep-22,Undisclosed,7,11,ShangriLa
One of the best hotels,"It is very hard to fault anything about this hotel. Its got some great facilities, the staff are excellent and the food in the restaurants for both breakfast and dinner is of a high standard.   For a high end hotel I was especially impressed by how well they cater for children with an indoor play area and outdoor pool with slides. They also provided a kids pack to my 4 year old upon check in which was a greT touch!",50,Jul-22,Travelled with family,19,34,ShangriLa
Best Hotel in Singapore,"Having lived in Asia as an expat for over 30 years, I’ve stayed at many top hotels for both business and holiday.  I can truly say, that the Shangri la, Singapore, is the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in Asia.   We were supposed to stay here one night, en route from Malaysia. We ended up staying here almost three weeks!  I had a major medical drama at the Shangri La.  In the middle of the night I was taken to a local hospital with pneumonia. The staff was helpful and supportive, quickly arranging a taxi in the middle of the night, extending our room and supplying us with special meal requests due to strict diet restrictions after I got out of hospital.  From the cleaning staff to the GM, the friendliness and personal care we received is unequaled in any hotel I’ve ever stayed.  …",50,Sep-22,Travelled as a couple,106,74,ShangriLa

Finally back to my Favourite Hotel,"It has been two years since my last visit to this iconic Singaporean Hotel.  The world has certainly changed due to the pandemic, constant lockdowns and of course the difficulty in travel. All of  these have thwarted my efforts to visit my favourite destination and also my favourite hotel.  Being a guest with over 45 years of experience, it has places me in a unique position.    Checkin didn’t go according to plans I am afraid, you see I requested the junior suite facing the pool, unfortunately someone decided that they would allocate my room to someone else. My profile clearly states my preferences but unfortunately even though the request was made well in advance my junior suite was city facing.  After two failed attempts to have my room changed,  I decided not to bother. …",40,Sep-22,Travelled on business,30,34,ShangriLa

And reception just informed me that they will give me a call soon but there was no reply to my call.   2) When I checked out, I told them ""I have to pay for 3 nights, since you cancelled my amount, so I paid.   3) After a month, I found that I have…",10,Aug-22,Undisclosed,1,0,ShangriLa

Must Stay Hotel,"Must try staycation at Shangri-la to experience a great stay! Shangri-la went beyond to ensure our stay would be memorable, and it was truly remarkable! In summary, kind staff, attentive services, generous and well designed hotel. We celebrated birthday, the amenity and decoration in room was nice. I'm thankful for. I was also given early check-in and late check-out, which gave the chance to explore the hotel as it's big. Breakfast buffet has wide variety and is delicious. Picnic in the garden concept were also good to try (if rain allows!). Would recommend to take pool view rooms, to have resort vibes, and hotel really have exceptional facilities for children!",50,Feb-22,Undisclosed,97,5,ShangriLa
Honeymoon at the Shangri-La,"We had our honeymoon at the Singapore Shangri-La. On arrival in our room we had a special cake, Swan towels and petals on our bed.

Hospitality was disappointing,"Booked the Shangri-La to celebrate a friend's birthday in Singapore and emailed them regarding this. Instead of suggesting recommended celebration add-ons or offering a complimentary cake (which Marina Bay Sands does), the reservations team  chose to advise me of their strict one-person limit for their standard double rooms. I was not intending to bring more than the one allowed guest but I find this reply to be very showing of what the staff prioritize.",20,Aug-22,Undisclosed,6,0,ShangriLa
Family resort that has seen better days,"There are lots of nice touches and highlight but the hotel has aged and a facelift is needed to bring it up to the expectation one has when staying at well stared resort like the Shangri-La. The check-in and check out process was kind, but very long and cumbersome. It’s a key area that needs up skilling and some tech efficiencies might help. Both processes (excluding waiting time) were 30-40 minutes. An area where the amount of staff didn’t make up for incompetencies. Unlike in the Restaurant, where the team varies in skill but sheer volume does cover up small errors. However on two  occasion we tried with little success to order a beer.  The food quality is fine, lots of choice. The Indian section by far the stand out. Venturing out of the hotel definitely deliveries better for…",30,Aug-22,Travelled with family,193,89,ShangriLa

Beautiful hotel but NO smoking rooms despite being advertised for them on trip advisor. Avoid outdoor breakfast,"The good:  Beautiful patio with plants and koi and squirrels. Very friendly staff. Good breakfast selection with fruits rotating over days.  The bad: No smoking rooms despite advertising them, which is deceitful and I wouldn't have booked had I known.  Avoid outdoor seating for breakfast, there are gangs of pidgeons and beos just waiting for the guests next to you leave their table to get some tea leaving their food on the table and they will make an absolute massacre of that food with one or two dozen birds, food and feathers flying all over the place.

Still a favourite,First time back since covid times. Travelled with a young child and we had an amazing stay overall. We stayed in the garden wing this time and I would say it’s worth the extra for the space and view. Room is clean and well maintained. We tried several f&b outlets while staying here and all the food was good. My son had a great time at splash and buds. The normal pool is also in good condition and not too crowded. All the staff were very attentive and kind to my son and our requests were generally promptly attended to. Only negative was that our bags took almost an hour to be brought to our room after check in and we had to follow up. Will stay again!

I do not mind waiting till 3:00 pm as I was early. 3:00 pm has passed and I asked the staff at the lobby counter about the status of my room. She informed that I have to wait 10 minutes more as the room was not ready. So, I waited 10 minutes and checked with her the second time. Again, I was told that the room was still not ready and was requested to wait further.  I waited the second time and after a few minutes, I approached another lady at the counter. Once again, I was asked to wait for a while. By then, it was already 3:30 pm, meaning to say it is 30 minutes past the indicated check-in time.

After a terrible experience at the airport, where families were ignored at security, we eventually arrived at the Shangri-la and met the lovey Diram at reception.

We have stayed at the Shangri-La before and loved the facilities. The grounds are amazing, and the pool is simply wonderful for kids. Those things haven’t changed, but a bunch of other aspects of our stay were really disappointing.   First of all, our room was changed without any notice to me to a room in the Valley Wing. I only found that out as we came to check our booking before departure. That meant that grandmother/Aunty would be staying in a different wing of the hotel, which was less than ideal.

At 500 square feet, the room continues to exude elegance and opulence like the common area of this property. What I like the most was it has struck a balance in creating such ambience without being too old-school. Yes, if you are a fan of W hotels, you might not like the abudant use of wood or this chandelier, but as luxury traveller, I found this room very comfortable and well kept.  Equally impressive is the bathroom, which is big enough to accommodate separate area for shower and bathtub.  The use of marble stone in the bathroom is very typical five star hotels.

However, after my last stay the hotel did not release my security deposit without any explanation.   It's been three months and the security deposit was still not released. From the front office there is no explanation, simply that they instructed their merchant bank to do so and ""it should be released in a few weeks"".  Not sure if it's a blatant scam or just incompetence. In any case, I paid twice for a week's stay and only get standard emails from their front office staff.

Shame on shangrila first and last time staying at this hotel brand !,As soon as we entered we told them we were not happy with the room.

They refused to also refund us so that we could not  find  another hotel either.  Shame on them.

Disappointed,"We were a disappointed in the room and the lobby bar service at this hotel. We stayed in the Tower Wing. We had a king room. These rooms are a bit dated, and oddly configured. The bed is angled in the room, which isn’t the best use of space and made an already small room seem smaller. Also, they had slippers in the room but no robes, which seemed odd. Perhaps housekeeping missed it? There was coffee and water in the room, which we appreciated. After checking in we went down to the lobby bar for a drink and a snack, and we never saw our server again after placing our order. Found and drinks came, but had to chase someone down for the check. For the money we paid, it felt overrated and disappointing.",30,Jul-22,Travelled as a couple,12,0,ShangriLa
Still Got It...Excellent,"Stayed here many times, on this occasion with my son and we had a thoroughly enjoyable stay. The rooms are beautifully appointed with everything you need, breakfast in the Valley Wing a real deluxe experience,  but most importantly the staff here are just excellent. Always a smile, warm, welcoming and so professional. A refreshing observation to actually see management around the Hotel, available to chat and supporting the service team, so important these days given the global staff shortage in hospitality. Will always use this Hotel when in Singapore.",50,Jul-22,Undisclosed,365,148,ShangriLa
Disorganised Hotel,Found used towels in room. Been given expired amenities. Lack of turndown service. Lack of consistency across all the staff. Been told different answers by different staff members regarding breakfast arrangements. Breakfast table cleared and ready for the next guest while I was up grabbing more food - Is this discrimination against solo travellers?

Excellent stay in Garden Wing,"We stayed in the garden wing for 5 nights.

Stayed at a deluxe room on the top floor of the wing, with great views of  Bukit Timah, the Shang gardens and pool below.

If one were to book 2 nights just for a session at splash it would be better to look at the buds annual membership and gain access to their pool without having to stay in their rooms. Good enough beds but way dated decor. But that is only because i was staying in the garden wing.   I believe i would have a better experience if my kids are aged 7 and above.

Enjoyable staycay and high tea at our favourite hotel!,"My son and I had a lovely staycay and we stayed at the beautiful Valley Wing. He really enjoyed all the facilities and Shang has taken over another 5-star hotel as his No.1 favourite now! Though I felt having to book the facilities was a bit stressful, as we couldn’t get reasonable time slots (6am pool was the only one available!). I would suggest hourly slots x 2 for each stay rather than 2-hour slots. We felt like we had to beg to use the pool for 30 mins to see if anyone left early.   However, I’ve always had a good time at any Shang property, whether it’s dining, spa or staycay.

The internet speed is excellent at 45Mbps download and 30Mbps upload.  The TV was small at 40"" and was so old that the colour had gone ""off"". Being ancient also meant that there was no screen mirroring or Chromecast capabilities.  The large bathroom had a large tub, and double vanities with lots of shelf space.

I read some parents reviews who had their staycation during school holidays with their children before I made the booking at Shangri-La. The purpose for this staycation is for my children because I read good reviews for children to spend their activities during the school holiday.   I was quite keen to book with Shangri-La when I read that some parents were given an early check-in at 10 am during the school holiday.  But not in my case, I had requested an early check-in on Tuesday during the school holiday but was rejected through the phone. So, I followed their “rules” and I arrived at 3 pm and still, the room was not ready. I was with my baby & my child was waiting for the…",30,Jun-21,Undisclosed,11,5,ShangriLa

Our Go-To Staycation,"Once again we had a wonderful stay at the Shang which has become our go-to hotel for staycations. Since October, the hotel has implemented the Shangri-la Experience App via a QR code which we found helpful and very easy to use.  The app provides information on the hotel, restaurants and spa along with various hotel services: in-room dining, housekeeping, mini-bar, laundry, etc. This is a great replacement for the old hard copy versions in light of Covid.  We stayed in the lovely Valley Wing.  One thing that really stood out about our room was the excellent work of the housekeeping staff.

Wonderful Staycation,This was our first time to Shang for staycation and I am so glad that we proceed with it even thou the restrictions were still in place. It was a much needed staycation for the kids as it was the school holidays and we couldn't travel due to Covid. The entire staycation was nothing short of fun. Buds and Splash were heaven for the kids. There were also activities such as treasure hunt which the kids get to explore around the hotel. We had in room dining for the 1st 2 days. Breakfast came in a very generous portion and dinner was great. Only some hipcups with the dinner ordering which took a while to get through but this did not dampen our spirits.

Due to Covid-19, there were restrictions on the number of guests for Buds, swimming pool and Splash zone. It was a little disappointed as all activities were fully booked upon our checked in. Fortunately, I was advised to put my name on the wait list and it cleared pretty fast! The gym was well equipped and specious, there was only a handful of guests during my visit at 9 a.m. The son mentioned that this was the Best Hotel Ever!

Most favourite SG hotel,"This is the third hotel of our hotels hopping staycation and not surprisingly, turned out to be the most enjoyable especially from the kiddo perspective.  This is also our second stay in Shang within a 6 months period; not my most preferred hotel but the kiddo most favourite. So I think Shang investing in kids friendly facilities is the right approach or business strategy.  This time round, the check in took much longer thereabout 40 mins, probably due to the complexity of my packages but I also realized that the front desk staff who attended to me is most likely a newbie. However, he has performed mostly competently.  The room, as usual, is well maintained and generally clean, except for a flattened bee found within the towel.

"Great ambience but some staff were too rigid, and the old facility may not be pram friendly","Went for a staycay in Nov 2020 on a family package. The hotel is huge and grand, and crowded as it was the school holiday period. They couldn't give us a room so they gave us 2 complimentary drinks. However, to redeem that 2 drinks, we had to make booking for a table at the cafe, and sort of were ""hinted"" to vacate soon.   Our room was at Garden Wing, with the balcony looking over the main road. Room was a bit aged, but it was fine. The lifts were always busy and crowded. Moving around the hotel was not too straight forward with a pram, such as going to the restaurant on the 2nd floor, or the breakfast next to the pool. The splash area was great for the kids, and the walk on the lawn was refreshing. Due to safe management measures, breakfast was ordered through the phone which…",40,Nov-20,Undisclosed,621,47,ShangriLa

Very Average 5 Star Hotel,"Just completed a staycation at the Garden Wing. The only positive comments I have about the hotel is the  grand lobby, the generous size of the room and the lush greenery.  Room was not ready when we checked in at 3.00. Only got our key to the room at around 4.15pm.  Unable to give us a late check out to compensate for the delaycheck in.  In my view, this is not the service one expects from a brand like the shangrila.  Room was a bit dated but that’s OK as room was reasonably clean. However the kettle in the room did not switch off by itself. We only discovered the defect when we realised that the kettle had boiled itself dry! Poor QC? Could be a potential safety hazard.

Good experience,"I stayed here last Dec, and decided to return again this week for the same valley Indulgence package. It was overall a pleasant experience, though we noted a few changes. In the valley wing club room, they no longer had a buffet line, but rather a designated tea & canapes set. It was definitely much safer by hygiene standards, though the service was slower. Also, they have implemented a booking for usage of the pool which is better to ensure that the number of pax is manageable, though this meant that you may not necc be able to get the pool at your preferred time. overall I enjoyed the experience  and especially the massage! :)",40,Mar-21,Undisclosed,63,30,ShangriLa

I was travelling with my 1 year old and 4 year old, and they had a wonderful time. Because of Covid, everything needs to be booked and our preferred times weren’t available, but we managed to work it out and get a good schedule. Buds was great (we’ve been there before as non guest), and the splash area that’s been refurbished recently was so much fun. The room was lovely (garden wing deluxe pool view), with a huge bath as well as a shower. We also ate at origins and the food was particularly fantastic, I love how they cater for both adults and kids with great food and good options.

The poor service started when we tried to book restaurant reservations for lunch and dinner over the 3 days. The hotel staff was adamant over the phone that all restaurants were fully booked despite us having $200 dining vouchers for use. However there were a lot of available slots when I personally went down to the restaurants.  On the first night, I was able to book The Line restaurant and we proceeded to order ala carte. We then waited 1 hour for a simple spaghetti and meatball dish. When asked why it took so long, the waiter informed that a overseas flight landed so they had to prioritize SHN travelers.

If I may suggest though to include the drinks I.e. coffee and juices in the online menu ordering system as in the third and last day of our stay we decided to eat outdoors instead and it took us sometime to be able to find someone to help us get our coffee and I had to go indoors after sometime and find another someone to request for the same coffee before it finally did arrived.

I wish to cover something more basic or what a traveler is looking for.  The bed is firm and it’s totally reminds me of hotel beds in China hotels. The interior is old whole grandeur / resort which also is a very popular interior choice of Chinese hotels in China.

Disappointing,"Currently checked into the hotel this weekend, all excited for our staycation for a belated bday celebration for our baby who turned one. Came with high expectations after reading the reviews online, hence requested for early checkin at 2pm if possible for baby’s feed time.   Checkin process was no issue but the person attending to us left a very sour taste in my entire experience as the first person to attend to us. JOVINN wasnt warm in her welcome, DID NOT explain about my booking and rooms to me, DID NOT explain about how i can book for Buds and Splash Zone.

"Worst Shangri stay hospitality by ZILA (valley wing, Jade member)","As a jade member i have stayed many  shangri la hotels internationally. This is by far the worst stay mainly Because Of the poor hospitality by the frontline check in staff, ZILA. As the first person we met and who attended to our stay,  she was hostile, unfriendly and unreasonable. It is the first time I’ve encountered such frontline staff, from shangri la nonetheless. Could the management seriously look into Zilas conduct as she totally ruined my staycation and this has never happened before for shangri la. Intend to also report her conduct to management too. This is a pity because all the other shangri la staff service was top notch and it’s A Great pity that Zila was the first person we met and unfortunately due to her, totally ruined the staycation experience.",10,Jan-21,Travelled as a couple,8,17,ShangriLa

Valley wing luxury and services are just wonderful.  Room, facilities, F&B, Spa are all excellent.

When I went back to the locker to get my phone, she approached me and let me know how I could use back the existing locker without moving my things to another locker.

In response to my review, the General Manager hoped to welcome us back for a renewed experience again at the hotel. Well, we were back again, to spend our New Year at Valley Wing.  The very moment I stepped out of the car at Valley Wing entrance, I could sense the difference. I was readily greeted by friendly and helpful doorman Ryan who immediately came forward to help me with my bag and opened the entrance door for me.

Disappointing Stay at the Garden Wing,"I have had 4 staycations at different five-star hotels recently and this was the most disappointing out of the lot.    Stayed for a night on a Sunday.

We were initially allocated a room on the 4th floor with a pool view (which I would recommend that you avoid; the lobby is on the 3rd floor), but to our horror, there was a trail of ants on the table after we came back from dinner (I have photos and a video) - we didn't eat in the room and had only made coffee.

This is the most awesome staycation I have experienced! What a blast!  We have 2 young children and booked a Garden Wing room at a very decent promotional price. The room is large and clean. As we visit during the start of school holidays, the hotel is running at full capacity and hence early and late check out requests may not be acceded. However, the hotel was very kind to allow us to check in at around 2pm although the official check in time is 3pm. Our request for late check out was not acceded but that is perfectly ok because we know the hotel is full and very busy.

Lots of fun filled activities provided by the hotel.  Tip: it’s better to book for 3D2N because it’s not as rush as compared to booking just 2d1n, to book direct with hotel rather than through klook because it’s more worth while with topping up the cost abit but you get more in terms of the range of activities and meals.

When we finally got our room, our bags were misplaced. We had to call housekeeping and repeatedly describe the colour of our bags to various individuals. This was extremely annoying given that our 2 toddlers (2year old and 1 year old) were already cranky and in desperate need of a diaper change and sleep.

Staycation at Valley Wing,"Not able to travel due to COVID-19 outbreak worldwide, I'm happy that Shangri-la Singapore has offered some staycation packages and we have delightfully opted to indulge ourselves with a weekend stay in the Valley Wing.  Not sure whether it's because we are locals staying in a local hotel or now it's during COVID-19 period and services have to be somewhat compromised, the level of service falls short of my expectation in few areas.  Guests recognition is lacking as compared to my stay at Horizon Club Floor at many other Shangri-la properties.

Great room but there are better hotels in Singapore,We stayed in a Horizon Club deluxe room - was modern and comfortable with an excellent view. The hotel is ideally situated and great for those who enjoy a walk.  The newly updated HC was well refurbished but large and overcrowded with people and screaming children. It felt like we were in an airport lounge and we fighting for a table. The food and beverages were average at best; some of the red wine not even drinkable.

Disappointing experience,"We spent 5 nights at this hotel with our 2 grandchildren, twins aged 3, together with their parents and maids, checking into 3 rooms of their Horizon Club.  The hotel was somewhat dated, however we did check in their Tower Wing, which was recently renovated. Even then, the rooms were not luxurious as I would expect from the Shangri La hotel chain and for some inexplicable reasons, the placement of the king bed was at a 45 degree angle, which made the room very odd indeed.  The hotel was not child friendly at all - the playroom was on a paid to use basis, something like Singapore $70 for a 3 hour use and only admit one accompanying adult. The Horizon Club (more about that later) was not opened to children between 5-8pm and when they were allowed to enter, they were confined to a…",20,Feb-20,Undisclosed,2,5,ShangriLa

Check-in was a breeze, and the room was probably one of the finest available in the 5-star category in the whole of Singapore.  No disappointment there.  When we wanted to get a quick bite on the night of our arrival, the Shophouse patisserie proved to be our first surprise.  Not only was the shop assistant unfamiliar with the range of their pastries and cakes available, she was also ill at ease at answering our questions on them.

Perfect for children ,"Stayed here for 5 nights over Xmas with a toddler and lots of family. Overall we had a great stay. Wonderful service from all the staff. Room requests were promptly attended to and the life guards at the pool do an amazing job watching over all the kids! Rooms are decently sized, clean and comfortable. No bidet in the toilet though. Shuttle service to orchard road was very punctual. Would’ve appreciated more frequent and later shuttle services though we still managed with taxis etc. The hotel did a great job decorating the hotel for Xmas and we (especially the toddler) loved all the Xmas ‘extras’ like Santa, the train ride in the garden and the chocolate snowman left in our room.

An Initial Disappointment Turned Around by Good Service Staff,"I booked a one-night stay on the 27th December, given room 1810 and then 0628. My initial check-in experience was quite a let down. Firstly, I had requested during my reservations for an early check-in as we had booked the place for a birthday celebration.   However, on the day itself at 1pm, I was told that there wasn’t any ready room. Worse, I had explained about my tight schedule that afternoon and asked for a rough estimation so that I could have a headway but only to be told they do not know in return. Without an estimation of how long the wait would be, I was left helpless as to know what to do next and could not go about the rest of the day’s program.

President Trump stayed here when he met Kim Jong-Il. I believe that this was the original Shangri-La hotel. You check in at the Valley Wing entrance. Your room key will only allow you access to your own floor in the lifts.   I had a suite with an enormous living room and bedroom and gigantic bathroom. Comfortable luxurious furniture and fittings.

"Great, but not outstanding","Stayed for two nights in November. The Shangri La is attractive, comfortable and does feel like an oasis of calm in the bust city centre.   If you want to be on Orchard Road, it’s close, but not quite on it. So you may wish to factor that in.   The lobby and pool were excellent. Room was comfortable, with a large bathroom. We stayed in the tower on the 12th floor and had good city views.   Breakfast was pretty chaotic. It was okay but I expected a nicer feel to a restaurant in the Shangrii La. It was a bit like a noisy canteen.

I had pre paid my accommodation.   So we arrived, were greeted beautifully, upgraded to a suite which was fantastic. After being shown to suite i was asked for credit card for pre authorisation. I explained i had asked this and was told no in writing this doesn't happen. Greeter said ok no problems and off she went.   So we go down to pool, have a swim then order a drink.

We had a small celebration for my son’s one year old birthday and the guests whom I’ve invited were very impressed by the room and the hotel.

Disappointed,Have stayed at the Shangri La on a number of times and rated it 5 stars and our special place in Singapore. But that was then this is now. The Hotel Foyer has been revamped and as a consequence the hotel has lost its allure. It has a cold impersonal air about it. The staff that were once friendly now seem distant. The Italian Restaurant which we looked forwarded to so much was a flop. Sea Food Marinara was luke warm and noticeable for its lack of sea food. The pasta was undercooked as well which made it difficult to chew. Breakfast was served in the Line and that's what it was. We formed a line and when a table became vacant the race was on to get it. We took turns in guarding our possession and getting our food in competition with quite a large number of fellow guests.…,30,Aug-19,Undisclosed,9,25,ShangriLa

Children's amenities had to be requested separately despite our informing we were staying with a child. Buds outdoor play/splash area was closed for renovation. This was either not disclosed on the website or we somehow missed it, which is a shame because the kids' area was a major draw for us.

Perhaps, they should consider putting the thermostat a bit. Not only will that save on energy, it will also make guests more confortable.

Super,After the hustle and bustle of the F1 GP it was an absolute pleasure to spend 4 days on some serious R and R. I cannot think of a better place too stay. Everything is done so well that I never have reason to make extra requests. I fact there is no reason to leave the sanctuary of the hotel. I do however like the Penang Shangri-La because they have an Adults only area pool for one wing of the hotel. Perhaps club rooms and suites should have inclusive soft drinks at the pool. Negating the need to go to the club lounge. Would be a great addition to the club room. ,50,Sep-19,Travelled as a couple,61,104,ShangriLa

True resort in Singapore,Shangri La is a true oasis in the city. I only wish I didn't have to work all day every day and could've enjoyed the hotel more. The hotel lobby is subtle but still stunning - particularly the garden wall above the lobby bar. The rooms are of course spacious and well appointed. Buffet is as you would expect dependably good food. I ate at Origin Grill and Waterfall restaurant and my meals were excellent (in particular the profiteroles at Waterfall!). The pool is stunning and I did squeeze in time to swim a couple of times. It's even heated so the water isn't a cold shock but is still sufficiently refreshing.,50,Sep-19,Travelled on business,5,12,ShangriLa

Other highlights included the lavish High Tea in the Rose Verandah, and the children's cookery lessons at Buds, which my daughter loved.

There is a great play area for children and tennis courts with coaching. It is an easy walk down to Orchard road but due to the heat and humidity in Singapore it is normal to get a taxi back to the hotel.

I personally do not have children, but I must say from the facilities I noticed - cooking classes for kids, a massive play area with slides, ball pit, kids club (looked cool! And for free if staying as a hotel guest!), family friendly pool - this really is the best hotel in Singapore if you have kids.

After a couple of minutes, and him checking with his manager  we were moved to another room. As my bags were in  the first room, it took them roughly 30 minutes to transfer my bags. I had to visit reception again to get this done. Not good aervice, especially from a hotel that prides itself on service. The pool  was good. The bed was a bit harder then i am used to but ok.

One big disappointment is the Horizon club. While the setting, the offering is absolutely superb, the evening shift employees have an attitude that simply shouldn't be acceptable in any five star hotel. Same gentlemen as the last previous visits, and same dissatisfaction. One feels that he is in a constant bad mood and not welcoming at all. Removing empty plates, glasses from table ? Nope, he doesn't do it.   I am surprised that he did not have extra training what hospitality is all about.",50,Jul-19,Travelled as a couple,116,86,ShangriLa

The only negative point I can say is, that their award system ""Golden Circle"" and their reservation system did not work properly in my first 20 years with Shangri-La Hotels (Singapore and many other I have been), and so at least 20 Stays were not counted.

I would like to give a special mention to all of the staff as they were so welcoming and helpful.

Lovely property and great location,"Only 30 minutes from Changi International airport and close to Orchard Road shopping with free shuttle to the ION shopping mall. Friendly and helpful staff. Great daily breakfast and lunch buffet at The Line with numerous choices. Relaxing spa (was able to book a massage within an hour after arriving at the hotel). Very nice pool view from my Tower Wing room. Loved that the Front Desk staff told me not to be alarmed if I saw someone in scuba gear in the pool after 10 pm - they were doing maintenance. Great afternoon ""Tea"" daily in the Horizon Club Lounge   For the meeting portion of our stay: Lotus I & II were a great size for our group of 20.

The hotel staff was very nice, the ladies and the gentleman at the kids club were amazing and very reliable. We absolutely loved their mini restaurant for the little guests.  I would like to mention one person's skills though; Sheela at The Concierge desk who was absolutely fabulous.

An exceptional experience,"Stayed with the hotel for a biz related trip on July, gotta say was pretty impressed with the architecture and service over here.  Under the recommendation of Stacy during check-in, I had decided to upgrade myself to club room and never looked back after since. Club lounge comes with one of the best view of sg skyline and definite good spread of buffet breakfast, the cocktail is definitely a huge plus too. Giving a special thanks to Syra whom I met her at line for being so attentive and polite and also Stacy for being always so friendly and approachable, addressing by name each time you saw me and the travel tips you gave was indeed a blessing to my mundane work trip. Would definitely recommend the hotel! Cheers!",50,Jul-19,Travelled on business,4,4,ShangriLa

I stayed at Sangri-La for one day and would've definitely extended my stay had it not been for my already bought flight tickets.  The breakfast buffet is one of the most spread out I've had till now.

The Line buffet dining,"We've used this hotel buffet many times in the past and it just seems to get better! The choice, as always, is fantastic, there's something to suit every taste. The table service is wonderfully efficient and everything seems to run like clockwork under the watchful eye of Hatim Zubair, the F & B Manager who made each visit seem like visiting an old friend. There is one criticism however which is not only unique to this place, many others also do not know how to cook Brussel sprouts, always uncooked and rock hard. Why? And why is there no gravy with the Yorkshire puddings and roast beef? Yes, they have jus but jus is jus and gravy is gravy.

The Valley Wing has a complimentary high tea and canapés which was such a lovely touch. My daughter loves Buds, the kids club area. We spent plenty time in the indoor play area.

The experience at Origin Grill was a newly added to-do list when in Singapore. The buffet at The Line was good at dinner but a la carte was poor with quality and truth in the menu. Love the concept at the Lobby Lounge to focus on local heritage. Keep going.  The not so good is the experience with laundry service which said our simple cloth is to thick to wash.

Worth Every Penny!  No one else compares.,"Flew from Houston to Singapore via Manchester and decided to book the executive room at the Shang-ri-La.  From the moment we arrived, they exceeded all our expectations.  We arrived at 9AM and they worked hard to find us a room.  We were escorted to the executive lounge and offered a wonderful breakfast.  Normally I’ve avoided this hotel as it is not in the middle of shopping. . .but what they lack in being a few more minutes away from Orchard Road is more than compensated by their quality of service.

Beautiful hotel but a bit off the beaten track (Orchard Rd.),"This is a beautiful hotel, with well appointed and well maintained rooms. The hotel pool is large and lovely.

That doesn't sound far (it isn't) but it is hot! in Singapore. If you want to see any of the sights in Singapore other than the shopping on Orchard Rd., this hotel is a bit less convenient that some others.

Our trail of problems began on day 2 when our bathroom started to leak water. The maintenance team promptly came to fix the issue and same time the guest relations team came to apologize as well. To our surprise, on day 2 the same issue happened and same time the AC stopped cooling which we later found it was linked to water leakage issue. The maintenance team allegedly fixed both issues same time and once again the guest relations team came to apologize with chocolates. On day 3, the…",30,May-19,Undisclosed,43,25,ShangriLa
The place of Presidents and Prime Ministers,"During our stay in Singapore we had a very bad experience regarding the hotel we were staying at. Having stayed here some 18 years ago I decided to show my new wife what pure luxury is all about.  We decide to visit for a few hours and find out what can be offered for next year.  Well!! what a surprise we had. We were greeted by 2 gentlemen and a lady, Annie, Mohamed Rani (Guest relations officer) and Peter from the lobby.  We experienced a welcome that I am sure is reserved for Presidents and Prime ministers. Whilst Mohamed secured some rates for us for next year, Peter took it upon himself to show us around the hotel and rooms. His enthusiasm for the hotel and the pride in his work was superb and a credit to this hotel. This was in total contrast to where we were staying.…",50,May-19,Travelled with family,47,133,ShangriLa
The Meaning of Shangri-La?,"Shangri la definition, an imaginary paradise on earth, especially a remote and exotic utopia. The staff and accommodations here most certainly strive to provide this experience for you. The city/state of Singapore is exotic to many for sure, and the Shangri-La Hotel helps define this great place. The service was exceptional, and being walked to my room by the person checking you in was a new experience, who then went over my accommodations with me.  I only ate breakfast at the hotel, but is was excellent, and the selections by culture were impressive to see, that wherever you were from they had you taken care of.  I stayed in the Valley Wing and the room was all that I could expect, which was top notch.  To go back to Singapore, this is where I would want to be, paradise......",50,May-19,Travelled with family,73,63,ShangriLa
Fabulous experience,"Hi, I checked in your hotel at orange grove road on 28th May 2019. I have to say you really have very outstanding staff with superb service attitude. Particularly your concierge, mr Johnny hor and Rajiv. They are so friendly and when I asked for some suggestion on where to go. They are so attentive and came out very good idea. Specifically, they even suggested me effective way of trip planning with the efficient way money spent. Thumbs up for their customers centricity mind set. Particularly we have two young kids along, this really helped. Also, in between my stay here, I got to go kulai, Malaysia. They help me to arrange for transport.

Disgusting,"I have tried to submit this review 5+ times and it never gets published.   This is our second stay at Shangri La Singapore. We weren’t overly impressed and had some minor issues the first time we were here but our son really enjoyed the pool and kids club so we decided to give it another shot. Today is our second day and we are so disappointed. Our Saturday checkout seems so far away and I’m afraid we are stuck here as we paid in full when we booked.   We made our reservation direct with the hotel a month ago over the phone and I put through some simple requests; a high chair for our son, the minibar to be emptied, that the coffee table in our room be removed (sharp corners & toddlers are not a good mix!), and a microwave. These were all confirmed by the reservation agent.  …",10,Sep-18,Travelled with family,24,82,ShangriLa

The room was very confortable and complete with all details that made my stay excellent, the 24/7 open gym, super useful but on top of it and more importantly a very attentive, professional staff. Indeed the kindness and professionalism of all people were impeccable. I had the opportunity to chat with Suzuna Tsuji, Guest Relations Officer, who has been extremely helpful and kind, I’d like to warmly thank her together with all the people (from F&B, cleaning, maintenance, etc.) I don’t have the names of but were amazing as well.

Great hospitality,"I stayed at Shangrila for a few nights in May 2019 with my husband and 5 year old child. It’s a beautiful hotel, with facilities for children (kids club, designated family area at breakfast). Despite being busy it never felt over crowed. Hospitality has been excellent- speacial mention to Veren who was very helpful and made our stay very welcoming and warm. Ayyappa in the kitchen who made food to order at breakfast and always willing to accomodate. Not to forget Johnny at concierge who is full of extremely useful tips on navigating the city!  Overall a true 5 star with a personal touch.  And a few words from my 5 year old who loved the pool, the little green area which she thinks is the jungle.

Ordered a 4 cheese pizza, pumpkin soup, a carbonara penne and a glass of Malbec wine for the dad. The servings were slightly large and were perfect for sharing with my dinner dates. Bread and breadsticks were served before the meals to keep our mouths busy. Food quality was pretty good with the 4 cheese as the favorite dish across the table.

The staff were all very friendly and attentive.  Do yourself a favour though and before you book this hotel, find out whether there is a Conference being held there during your stay! 3 days of our 5 were busy with conferences and this spoilt the whole ambiance of the hotel!

It wasn't something we could overlook this time.  They also looked tired. The view was of a large concrete looking building. It was probably highlighted more this visit as we also stayed at another hotel near the marina which had magnificent views and also had much larger rooms.

On entering, we were greeted by a genuinely warm smile from Katherine. She took time to explain all of the dishes available if we selected the buffet spread, and to recommend some of the most popular options, including the Bak Chok Mee that we really enjoyed.

On the negative side for a personal holiday the pool was quite hectic and filled with families, hard to find space to swim, though I realize the hotel is geared for families so I was glad we had booked the club since no kids allowed after 6:30 PM :-).

We had five rooms and I needed to have a late check out for one of the rooms and she would not budge! I had to talk to a different front desk staff to sort this out.  The pool is really nice, a 40m one, so it is very good for the morning swim. I would stay there again if I come back to Singapore. ",40,Mar-19,Travelled on business,323,122,ShangriLa

Excellent Service Staffs at the Rose Veranda and the Lobby Lounge,"It was over the Chinese New Year period that I was over at Shangri-La Hotel for a Chinese Reunion Dinner. It was on the 16th February which was a Saturday. I was pretty early (dinner was at 6.30pm and I was there at half 4).  We went over to the Lobby lounge for a cuppa; As they were only serving local delights (local Singaporean Kways and Cakes); I wanted some traditional scones as it was tea time; they unfortunately do not serve them at the Lobby Lounge; but the Service Manager at the Lobby Lounge COLLEEN was kind enough to leg all the way up to the Rose Veranda Lounge, up a big flight of stairs on the second floor, which i followed suit behind COLLEEN bcos i was a little embarrassed to let her do the running  (for those of you who has been to Shangri-La will know the stairs)…",50,Feb-19,Travelled with family,1,0,ShangriLa

A solid 4 star experience,"Was excited about the prospect of staying at the Shangri-La but was pretty underwhelmed by what, although a solid 4 stars, did not match the 5 star experience I was expecting. I am sure they do have 5 star rooms but ours in a tower wing deluxe room was definitely 4 star. Clean and nothing wrong with it just lacking that little something extra.  The location is a bit out of the way of everything but they do have a free shuttle bus which takes you in the general direction of Orchard Road. Breakfast at the Line restaurant was great with a massive choice including everything you could think of pretty much, however the decor is very ""UK motorway cafe"" which lets it down.",40,Jan-19,Travelled as a couple,212,130,ShangriLa

The hotel became a giant childrens' playground with no boundaries. The pool area became a football pitch and although the pool itself was divided the children and their parents totally ignored this. It was hard to move around because of all the selfies being taken and there was no peace from the noise of children playing and mobile phone calls (for some reason with the phone held about 12 inches from the face to encourage shouting).

We were booked for a one night pre-cruise stay included in our cruise fare. Our room in the tower wing had the king bed at a peculiar angle to accommodate a not too large room with a not to large bathroom, both of which appear to have been recently remodeled.  The view from this seventh floor room of a roof top was not particularly inviting.  Breakfast was equally unremarkable in a vast and unattractive buffet restaurant.

Our room led through to a safari themed children's room which would sleep 3 children. There was one canopy bed, made to look like a safari tent with a pull out trundle underneath and another bed that pulled down from the wall. There were safari murals on the wall and you could also enter the room through a tiny cupboard door in the main bedroom (a special entrance just for children!). It…",50,Jan-19,Travelled with family,3,2,ShangriLa
Still a gem but needs a polish to really shine,"We stayed at Shangri-La Valley Wing for 5 nights.  As return guests of the Valley Wing, we are well accustomed to the impeccable service of the staff and our experience on this occasion was no different.  Nicole was fantastic at check in and servers Carlito and Khair were friendly and attentive.  A facial and massage at Chi The Spa is a relaxing way to spend an hour or two.  The spa facilities and treatment rooms are clean and comfortable.  The staff are so friendly and welcoming.  Although the Valley Wing has been a favourite of ours when visiting Singapore, we note the following observations from our recent visit.  • The breakfast menu (in the Summit room) could be improved by offering a broader selection of food on the buffet, although the hot food options are good and cooked…",50,Jan-19,Travelled as a couple,63,92,ShangriLa
One of the best!,"The minute you are greeted by the staff outside (quite the uniforms) and escorted inside by other completely professional staffers you know you are in good hands.  Efficient check in ,  beautifully appointed room with all amenities, fantastic pool and grounds- what else: close proximity to Orchard street shopping...easy walk.",50,Jan-19,Travelled as a couple,294,113,ShangriLa
Fantastic stay,"The hotel is stunning and has so much to offer for couples and families! The gym was especially good!  My partner and I were lucky enough to have one of the club rooms where we could access the Horizon club, highly recommend that if you can afford it, the canapé and drinks period fro. 5-8pm was fantastic and especially great if you love nice wine as Alcohol is so expensive in Singapore!",50,Jan-19,Travelled as a couple,3,3,ShangriLa
You’re simply the best!,"Arriving for a two days stop over, playing golf in Singapore, but unfortunately I’m not a pro taking part in the HSBC Open at Sentosa, so chose this hotel and played other courses. The hotel is just outstanding, or like a taxi driver told: 6-Star! From service and helpfulness to all the facilities, which I only could partly enjoy (second day afternoon pool seemed closed due to thunderstorm by regulation) in that short time. Had a great time and will come back here!",50,Jan-19,Travelled solo,2039,369,ShangriLa
Vacation,"Lovely pool with lush garden griunds and attentive staff.  About a half hour walk to the Botanical Gardens.  A must see at the Botanical Gardens is the orchid section.   If it is hot outside, it would be advisable to take a taxi.",50,Jan-19,Travelled as a couple,20,19,ShangriLa
Family stay in the Treetop Family Suite,"We just had a fantastic two night stay in the Treetop family themed suite. The room was amazing. The kids loved the cubby house to sleep in, as well as the hidden bed in the wall. They also loved the secret doorway between the two rooms. They had their own bathroom with a nice bath. We had our our en-suite - it was nice not to have to share with the kids!  Our bed was massive! And very comfy. We loved the big fridge, the bay window with booth seating and the access to a washing machine and dryer. The kids enjoyed Buds (kids club) and went every day, sometimes twice. We also loved the treasure hunt around the hotel, the kids welcome gifts on arrival and the regular access to fresh fruit on our floor and in our room. We could either have breakfast in the Horizon Club or in The…",50,Jan-19,Travelled with family,21,27,ShangriLa
Exactly what you'd expect from a Shangri-La,"Definitely one of my favourite brands and the original hotel that started the chain did not disappoint.  The entrance and lobby is very grand.  We had booked a Horizon Club room so went to the 24th floor to check in.  Our room was a bit small but newly renovated as was the rest of the Tower Wing.  We very much enjoyed the Horizon Club Lounge - maybe too much.  Due to its convenience and comfort, we weren't motivated to endure the heat and explore the hawker stands as originally planned.  In fact, we were even advised by friends to try the hawker food in the lobby lounge as it was curated by local hawkers.  Staff were always available, friendly and courteous to all of our needs.  The only complaint - and this is a personal preference thing - is that the mattress was a bit too…",50,Dec-18,Travelled as a couple,50,74,ShangriLa
Absolute excellence in every respect,"The foyer was bedecked with stunning Christmas decorations, the room was superb in every way, the breakfast first-class. But what really stood out was the warmth of the staff whatever their role. Each was so welcoming, friendly, helpful and genuinely enthusiastic,  whilst still displaying total professionalism. They showed pride in providing exceptional customer service to one and all. The Shangi-La Singapore set a high standard - one which totally eclipsed their hapless 'sibling' hotel in Kowloon, which was woefully inadequate across several measures.",50,,Travelled solo,46,70,ShangriLa
