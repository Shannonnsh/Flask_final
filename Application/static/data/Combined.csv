Enjoying Singapore ,"Excellent property and a very convenient  location.  The hotel is close to many shopping centres and attraction sites and it is a  3 minute walk to the train station ( MRT )  . The front desk staff are extremely efficient, pleasant and helpful. The property is clean and has a fantastic  charm.The room  is spacious,   clean,  very comfortable and  equipped with all the amenities that a traveller might need. Also , the room has plenty of drawers to store your stuff.  Despite the fact that this hotel is located in the heart of the city , the rooms are very quiet and have a calming vibe every time i enter the room . Expect a free, fast-speed  internet and a TV that you can connect to your device. I just love this place and I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family .  ",50,Oct-22,Travelled as a couple,33,10,Carlton
A great holiday at the Carlton - Singapore,"We just came back from a wonderful week in Singapore, where we stayed at the Carlton. It was the first time we stay at the hotel and were pleasantly surprised! We couldn;t have asked for a better location, it's in the center with a close proximity to 2 MRT stations, surrounded by shops, walking distance to museums, and great places to dine. I was specially impressed by how friendly the staff is! The concierge Mr Ali was extremely helpful and always greeted us with a smile, gave us a map, explained where everything is and suggested places to dine in and visit. The hotel is very clean, sanitisers are located everywhere, the rooms are extremely spacious and toiletries are provided individually wrapped. We're definitely going to stay at the Carlton in our next visit to Singapore!",50,Jun-22,Undisclosed,5,2,Carlton
Gone down hill in a big way.,"I’m staying at the Carlton for 12 nights. 2 more long nights left. Always speak highly of it and it’s my preferred SG hotel as it’s so convenient. Not this time. It’s been an unpleasant long stay. Stained floors where it looks like a murder has taken place which is disgusting. Moisture stained/damaged roof, moisture dripping down all over the wall. No hot water in the shower morning or night regardless of the time. Room generally smells like a damp musty dungeon. Everything in the room feels moist and sticky. Wi-Fi that intermittently works. Room service that was cold and missing the key component of the meal. Pool area and bar that shuts at 7pm. I can appreciate that it was Grand Prix week but this a 5 star hotel at $300 a night in what is supposed to be the “premier wing”. If the basics aren’t done right it’s completely unforgivable. The rooms need just as much attention as the nice looking lobby. Wish I could get some of my $4,000 back. Hostel would have been a better option at least I could have gotten a hot shower.…",20,Oct-22,Travelled solo,33,10,Carlton
Excellent hotel,"Excellent. Dad and 2 teenage sons stayed 5 nights for the F1 GP.  Requested rooms to be close by and twin beds in one room.  Ended up getting adjoining rooms which was fantastic.  Rooms spacious, clean and comfortable.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Made good use of the Gym and pool.  Breakfast was excellent. Good location and easy to get around from there.  Will definitely stay here when next in Singapore.",50,Oct-22,Travelled with family,18,41,Carlton
Business,"Clean hotel, but check-in was an issue. When we finally got into our room 12.30 am. We tried to make a call to get a drink or milk, no one answered the phones for over 20 minutes. Staff was very friendly but the breakfast was a little plain. Neet to get a better coffee bean for the machine.",20,Sep-22,Undisclosed,48,27,Carlton
Great location,"A convenient, friendly hotel.  Not elaborate but nice rooms.  The same goes for the morning buffet.  The staff was very kind.  There were a lot of flight crews checking in and out, so getting service at the reception desk could take a bit of time.",40,Sep-22,Travelled on business,18,14,Carlton
Exceptional Receptionist,"I often come to Singapore as I work for an airline. Carlton hotel offers always a premium service. Their staff even in the busiest moments are always friendly and professional and they try anything possible to please their customers. I would like to highlight how exceptional is Azlina, a reception agent.  She always goes above and beyond finding a solution and displaying incredible professionalism, empathy and love for her job. Thank you",50,Sep-22,Travelled on business,8,2,Carlton
Pricey hotel in a central location,"Located near Chijmes the Carlton is an excellent hotel for business travellers and for vacation. Some of the corner rooms are great, but can be noisy (live music). Infrastructure and food leave little to be desired. Staff are friendly and courteous.",40,Aug-22,Travelled on business,47,50,Carlton
Great location and large rooms,"Stayed one night at this hotel prior to flying to Thailand. Great location next to Raffles hotel and Raffles shopping centre. Staff are lovely and attentive, rooms quite large in size. Wifi is a bit patchy from the rooms but otherwise happy with the cleanliness of the room. Would stay again",40,Sep-22,Travelled with friends,1689,194,Carlton
Terrible Cleanliness,"I stayed here once before and had an enjoyable stay. However, this time I booked a room for my sister and her family but the room was so terrible. The drainage was clogged. I took a shower just only 5 minutes then the floor in toilet bowl area was all wet and bath tile edge seal was mold. Disappointed.",10,Sep-22,Undisclosed,5,0,Carlton
Loved our stay here. Gorgeous room and great location and breakfast,Can't fault this hotel. Was a little worried about some of the reviews and also knowing this is an older hotel but was pleasantly surprised to find it's been renovated and everything about it from our experience was great!  Positives: - Amazing view! - Great location! - Large buffet breakfast with heaps of options.  Negatives. - Like all of Singapores 5 star hotels it's pricey but on the lower end I think?  Would definitely recommend to stay here and book a room with included breakfast.,50,Sep-22,Undisclosed,104,97,Carlton
"Nice hotel, some confusion about payment","The hotel is very nice and in.a convenient location in central Singapore.  The breakfast buffet is good, but some variety would have been good for a multinight stay.  Internet was stable.  I had some problems with my advance payment, but this was taken care of.  Pool area is nice, but closes early.",40,Aug-22,Travelled on business,43,52,Carlton
Very average experience,"I recently stayed at the Carlton Hotel for 5 nights for a business trip and it was a bit of a mixed bag. Whilst the hotel and room is quite nice my main issue was with the staff who in my opinion failed to deliver.   During check in, the staff did not greet me nor did they crack a smile during the whole process. When I asked about the breakfast timings I was basically cut off and told that this would be explained to me when he was done. Not a great start to my stay.   Even worse was the check out as I had asked for a late check-out the day before and the lady confirmed that I could leave at 3PM. The next day my room key did not work when I came back from a meeting at around 1PM and when I approached the reception I was very rudely told (by Yogesh I think his name was) that I…",30,Aug-22,Travelled on business,157,211,Carlton
Great location,We stayed here for five nights and it was a great choice. The hotel is perfectly located to discover the city.We had a room at the 14 th floor (prime room) and we had a wonderful city view. Breakfast was very good ( if they could add pancakes every day it would be great!!) The pool was the only thing that we didn’t like but this is totally personal All in all we had a great stay and would go back again,50,Jul-22,Undisclosed,45,52,Carlton
bad service and housekeeping,"sustained a deep cut due to a sharp edge on the weighing machine in my room toilet. called for room service to address the matter and get first aid. manager and staff did not apologise at all. NO follow ups were made after as well.  instead, the manager took away the weighing machine and claim he will do further investigation. what investigation may i ask? to do DNA test on the sharp edge and check if i was lying? i was already bleeding profusely and my blood wasn’t stopping.  some amenities were dirty and chapped, unless ur trying to get ur kids injured and receive unprofessional services after, do not recommend especially if you have kids.   during my stay after the accident, a decent follow up and apology would have been appreciated. however, NOTHING was done.",10,Aug-22,Travelled as a couple,1,0,Carlton
Location location location,"An agency booked the hotel for me and I didn’t expect anything other than just a business hotel.  On arrival I realized I can cross the street to have my first Singapore Sling at the Raffles Hotel, and only one block away from the wedding scene church location  in Crazy Rich Asians. Food courts and restaurants surround the Carlton, so I didn’t get to experience food much inside Carlton other than the included breakfast. Too bad breakfast starts at 7 am and for a few days I wish it could have started at 6 or 6:30 am when I had to be picked up early. The Carlton is highly centrally located, clean, modern, and the staff is exceedingly polite and friendly. Though there are fancier hotels in Singapore, like the W, Mandarin Oriental, and the legendary MBS (all at 2 or 3 times the…",50,Jul-22,Travelled on business,2,4,Carlton

Good but not great,"Rooms are large and clean and in-house foods are yummy especially ""Seafood Hor fun"". The location was amazing as well, being right next to City Hall MRT, and walking distance from multiple malls. Wifi had good connectivity.  Disliked · breakfast choices, there were not many choices and they were always the same, for s$40 breakfast not worth. The reception staff needs to be polite and welcoming and not show a straight face. the bed was not comfy. I stayed with my wife and 4 years old toddler it was not king size, not a large queen was some in-between. and as we requested a way ahead two double beds and it was in a different floor so they could have changed all 3 rooms but they were not so helpful. though the overall stay was okay but not great. So next time I will prefer to stay…",30,Jul-22,Undisclosed,73,59,Carlton

Elegant Hotel,"I am a regular customer to Carlton hotel Singapore, they always maintain the high standard but my recent stay has showed they had dropped a bit in the cleanliness standard. The bottom of the shower glass door and bathroom seals in my room were very moldy, the cleaner need to use bleach to clean them.  My other complaint as  usual as other customers were the breakfast choices, there were not many choices and they were always the same, fried noodle everyday, after staying the third days my family and I had decided to skip the prepaid breakfast.    the last but not the least, the reception staff needs to be polite and welcoming not showing a straight face.",40,Jul-22,Undisclosed,17,35,Carlton
3 star hotel room with 5 star hotel price..,The room is like a 2 or 3 star hotel…it’s very dark inside with no view at all. The water temperature is very unstable. Sometimes it’s very cold and sometimes it’s very hot. There are ants in the room. Definitely not recommending this hotel as it is not cheap at all. We have changed to another hotel in Singapore with a lower price but what we get is much better. The only good thing about Carlton is that there’s screen mirroring in the tv so that you can watch Netflix and YouTube there.,10,Jul-22,Travelled as a couple,2,0,Carlton
Executive room facing buildings…,"I booked a night stay for executive room, I booked via Traveloka and the price states that Executive rooms are more expensive than Premier room so I was expecting a room with a nice MbS as seen on the website. Upon check-in, I was surprised that our room’s view was buildings and buildings. I was so disappointed as I booked the room for birthday celebration and checked with the reception who told me the better room is Premier room. This happened to be long weekend and they insisted that premier rooms are full.  In room dining service and room service requesting for extra blankets and pillows were good and fast! Location is very good as it’s just opposite Raffles City shopping centre but I will not visit again to stay in a room facing buildings. Pool is very small and can forget…",20,Jul-22,Travelled with family,99,59,Carlton

Ok hotel but missed the details,"Stayed for three nights at the start of my honeymoon. Hotel was fine in the whole, good location and very clean with COVID precautions. Although they were aware of our honeymoon, they never acknowledged it at all ☹️ There was a water leak on the carpet which we informed the staff about, but they never responded with a reason or change of room. As a westerner, it felt like the staff were only interested in their Asian clientele. I would choose a different hotel next time I visit.",30,Jun-22,Travelled as a couple,3,0,Carlton
Fantastic hotel in a great location,"Fantastic location and close to Raffles City shops, food court and the MRT. Rooms are clean, modern and well maintained. Housekeeping were happy to provide extra towels and ice. Great staff at the Carlton all very friendly and happy to assist us.  What was outstanding for us was on our first day at the hotel we took a taxi to Makan Sutra Gluttons Bay for dinner I left my wallet behind in the taxi. All I could remember was the driver was Indian, I didn't know the taxi company or noticed his name. I took a chance by ringing the Carlton concierge and explained about my lost wallet.

two night layover,"As a member of Accor, IHG, Marroit & Hilton, this was not my choice. But travelling with my parents and they have stayed here numerous times and wished to do so again. For them close to church, MTR and Raffles City plaza. Check in and out is smooth despite a lot of other people doing the same. A lot of airlines including BA use this hotel.  Dont get stung by the buffet price like we did. We wanted someting quick and decided to try the hotel buffet. We were not told upon entering that it was a special seafood night and the cost $118 per person not the usual $35 per head. After a long flight, busy day and being with my parents, we definately needed a drink. NO BAR. It is a good hotel, but unlike my parents, not what I prefer in accomodation",30,Jun-22,Undisclosed,27,47,Carlton
Good location. Ask for newer rooms.,"Great location. Walking distance to Bugis Junction and plenty of options for food nearby at CHIJMES. Good service & helpful staff. I think my room is newer as I also go to my friend's room on the other wing and it's a bit outdated. So I recommend to ask for newer room.

Standard hotel with convenience location in the city center,"Highlights are convenience location near city hall, Raffles shopping area, some walks to Suntec ,Bugis and MRT Raffles city.

Not Recommended,"We stayed here for 4 nights during the Eid holiday. On a positive notes, room was clean and spacious, Housekeeping was quick abd efficient, the location is fantastic for tourists. However, the service at the Front Desk was incredibly rude and I failed to express with words how upset I was upon check in. I left a feedback on the first night itself, only to be contacted by the Duty Manager on my 3rd day staying. He called to extend his apologies but then no action or service recovery was rendered. I saw other guests who checked in received such fabulous service with politeness, I wonder why it was not extended to me during check in?",10,May-22,Travelled as a couple,146,54,Carlton

City Staycation,"It was a nice staycation at Carlton hotel as the crowd was not as packed compared to the peak season. Checking in and out was a breeze with minimal waiting time. Hotel guests were mostly tourists and business travellers. The room was spacious, clean and toiletries were sufficient. Walking distance to shopping malls and various restaurants was a stone’s throw away. Buffet breakfast was great with a variety of choices. Parking facilities is situated at the hotel lobby with much convenience.",50,Apr-22,Travelled as a couple,46,16,Carlton
Unpleasant check-in makes an unpleasant staycay,"Front desk experience set the staycay mood.  Check-in experience was unpleasant. Staff received me without a smile (can tell from the eyes under the mask). Requested for a higher floor room and was assigned to 11th floor. Power slot in that room was faulty. Went back down to same staff. No apologies rendered for the inconvenience. Was then assigned to another room in Level 12. So apparently, there were rooms available in higher floors but staff didn’t do her best to assign it to me in the 1st instance.   Rooms have a strong musty smell.  Bathroom is more impressive than the main area in premier room. Volume in bathroom is spolit. Toiletries were in-house brand n shower gel is lumpy.

Checking in was a breeze and Adrian made me feel very welcome with his top-notch service.   5 stars for the room. I booked the Premier room which comes with a bathtub and a rain shower. Cleanliness was at its best, extremely well-maintained and nicely renovated with trendy marble look-alike bathroom wall tiles.

I emailed them multiple times to request a change of dates but they did not have the courtesy to even respond leaving me in a complete limbo. i still dont know if i still have a room or will get my money back if i dont have the room.    As a business traveller, i find this attitude totally disgusting.",10,Mar-22,Travelled on business,1,0,Carlton
Long hour of waiting to check in.,"I arrive early at 12ish to check in early or to avoid queue. The staff got me to register and told me that they will call me if they have a room. Not only he didn’t call, we have to re queue for an hour to get our keys. I a prowl of 3 hours, no one bother to honour the promise to call me when there’s room. We came back on time and queue. Carlton literally took one hour away from paid time. We are supposed to check in at 3pm, and at 4pm we are still queuing. Standing for an hour. This is not the first time you have handled crowd.who is going to compensated the one hour of waiting, standing and the promise of call back. Very disappointing to be ignore like that. Bad experience started even before the hotel stay. Horrendous!",10,Mar-22,Travelled with family,4,2,Carlton
great staycay with friends,"Great place to staycay with friends. They didnt have connecting rooms but they gave us rooms side by side, the room was really big and spacious, there was a seating by the window, a sofa chair, a desk, chair plus extra space to put luggage. One bad thing was the air conditioning wasnt that cold so we had to set it pretty low but after that it was ok. Check in was really smooth! will definitely stay here again",50,Mar-22,Travelled with friends,153,79,Carlton
Ideal location.,"The hotel is strategically located. I stayed at the Premier Room which overlooked Raffles Hotel’s swimming pool. The room was spacious and clean but the decor may be a little dated. Also, the room setting is rather dark. It seems to be poorly lit. Breakfast at The Mosaic was alright. To conclude, nothing really bad but nothing exceptional either",30,Oct-21,Undisclosed,31,15,Carlton

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"Nice hotel well fitted out and comfortable rooms. Great location for shopping and access to other parts of the city via bus, taxi or MTR. Staff were exceptionally friendly and courteous. Nothing was too much to do and they were always smiling and ready with a greeting. Great coffee shop, Tuxedo and restaurant Wah Lok. Breakfast was good more of a fixed set menu's but under covid conditions much better than I expected. Again staff excellent.

"Good, could have been better",Stayed 3D2N here. Good to have smoking rooms especially since i am a smoker. Hotel was clean and the right size. My only problem was there were no dressing rooms at the swimming pool vicinity. My pool time was also disturbed by some youths who were monkeying around in the main pool with their ball game and splashing water everywhere. Would have helped if hotel staff keeps an eye once in a while.,30,Jan-22,Travelled with family,65,10,Carlton
Good place for a solo staycation,"stayed at the carlton hotel for a night over the past weekend at room 1380. the place is great for those who are staying solo. room is cosy and comfortable enough. the only downsides of my stay are that some of the gym equipment were not available for usage and that the bathtub was a bit narrow for me to lie down.  nevertheless, am thankful and appreciative that i got upgraded from a deluxe to a premier room. thanks to dian for checking me in and the gym staffs on shift on 18th dec afternoon and 19th dec morning for facilitating my use of the gym (apologies as i didn't get your names). breakfast was alright and express check-in was seamless.",40,Dec-21,Undisclosed,4,0,Carlton
First Staycation,I had my very first staycation at Carlton hotel last year during Christmas holidays. Me and my husband stayed at premier room (room no: 1582) with pool view. Our room was at the end corridor which overlooked Bras Basah. Chek-in time was staggered so we got to early check in at 12pm which was very good as we heard all hotel check -in start after 2pm. The room was very spacious with king bed and the best part of room was their marbles bathroom with big bathtub.

Booked on a b&b basis and breakfast was taken at the Mosaic restaurant.  Although a limited menu of about 5 sets service was good and staff very friendly. I was even taught how to use chopsticks - which is not my normal choice of cutlery.

Am being generous with the 2 stars,"Positives: - Room was clean albeit tired-looking - Bathroom is beautiful. Not sure if they renovated it recently  - Big sized bathtub - Early check-in  Negatives: - Service is the worst I’ve experienced in any Singapore hotel.  - Right from the start at check-in we knew we were gonna be continuously disappointed. We had the quietest check-in with Adrian who didn’t even greet us or ask us for our ICs. We just stood there staring at him with zero conversation or personalisation. He did not even go through the reg card with us just simply asked us to sign at the bottom. Didn’t tell us what room we booked for, how many nights or any safety measures. Hello, Covid???

SHN stay was poorly managed by Carlton hotel,"I am currently serving my SHN at Carlton hotel with my husband and unfortunately the experience has been really bad for us.

Lunch again was served for one and we had to call back for the second.  There were multiple days when breakfast and lunch were delayed. We also requested for the menu at least 5 times since Day 2 and each time told they will 'inform the food team' to send to us, but eventually we only got the menu shared on Day 11.

Check in was a breeze and we got a room facing Bras Basah.. so was glad the reception staff are very helpful to help us change a room and got us a Suntec City view instead.

There were no contingency plans and staff were not well trained to deal with the issues presented. No one was on site to assist the poor staff and to assist him. He had to manually check if the rooms were ready. When asked if there were alternative arrangements, staff were unsure. When we reached our room, the TV was not working.

"Big, comfortable, soulless ","Visited during a quiet period due to the virus impact on tourism and it makes it difficult to assess what this property would be like during normal operations. Everything was smooth and efficient but almost inevitable for such a large hotel it lacks any real character and is best treated as just a place to rest ones head overnight.  The room, basic “deluxe” was perfectly adequate and met the key requirements for a city centre hotel in that it was well soundproofed with a comfy bed, excellent shower and good blackout curtains.  The pool is unusual in having a good deep end and is better for swimming than as a general lounging around area.

On our last morning we left our suitcases to be looked after as we were not flying until the evening. One of our cases was a little damaged but still alright to use. We left to walk around the city and do last minute shopping. We decided to buy a replacement suitcase for our sickly one and we would ask the hotel to dispose of the old.

Right in opposite of famous Chijmes hall with several dining places, it is also nice to get a tasty bite there, before going to bed (a bit pricey, though). The room did not meet my expectations to 100% as it felt a bit too „business hotel like“ and not really individual, although everything was clean and in order.

Great location,We stayed here for 3 nights over new year.

The rooms themselves are quite large and clean although I did have a tear on the bottom sheet that I noticed as soon as I pulled the covers off the first night...not sure how someone doesn’t notice this when making the bed? Breakfast plentiful but busy and as previously stated my husband heard a senior staff member speaking in an aggressive manner to other staff members in full view of customers not the thing that should be done and needs to be dealt with by management ASAP.

The Premier Club lounge has a great view and offers a much more relaxed breakfast option and the evening happy hour includes drinks and snacks. Alcohol is quite pricey in Singapore so if you like a glass or two of wine in the evening, this is great.   The staff in the lounge were excellent and couldn't have been more helpful. We arrived at the hotel very early in the morning and while we were hopeful, we didnt expect to be in our room until later in the day.

The room had everything needed and the facilities were good.

Great location but misleading info provided,"When i booked this hotel, I was contacted via email there were no smoking rooms but there was a smoking area on level 4. Upon check in, the man said the same thing and then quickly said there actually was no smoking area at all, only outside on the street. If I knew that was the only place I could smoke, I would not have booked this hotel. As a result of this inconvenienve I didn’t end up spending much time at the hotel. Waste of money really. If you’re not a smoker, no issues for you - but it was the misleading information that the hotel provided me with that annoyed me.

All the staff here are excellent, they will do anything to make sure your stay is enjoyable. The selection of food  in the lounge for both breakfast and canapés in the evening was very, very good.  The only downside (which is the reason the Carlton hasn't received 5 out of 5) is the Wi-Fi. It is really awful, it's advertised as high speed but believe me it isn't and that really makes a difference.

AVERAGE HOTEL,"I will like to write a review compared to similar hotels in Singapore and else where in the world in price bracket and star rating DINING: Paper napkins in dining hall breakfast, 4/ 5 star hotels normally provide a cloth napkin.Not even a tea spoon but a wooden stirrer for coffee. For God's sake I was not at McDonald's.Fruits not cut well,just some chunks cut and thrown in for breakfast. To maintain the start rating the food has to be displayed well  Not adequate staff.A queue to get your eggs made is a terrible idea. And then to collect again.

We got a package to include a buffet breakfast which catered to all tastes, coffee and tea was not to our liking and thought that it could be improved. Showers area available on the fourth floor so that you may freshen up before your flights after booking out from your room. (Hard to keep things dry in this area. Maybe a storage area to place your suit case whilst in the shower could be included, otherwise suggest that you take the items from your suitcase and leave your bags in the holding area at checkin/checkout area.)",50,Sep-19,Undisclosed,22,49,Carlton
Very good,"Huge hotel ideally placed for both business and tourist interests delivered pretty much what I would expect.   I’ve seen several critical reviews of staff but I found from check in to concierge to cleaning staff everyone was smiling and genuinely helpful  The room was generic hotel but none the worse for that. Highlights were the fabulous mattress and efficient air-conditioning.   The bath was a little small and the control for drain plug was near broken and I had to twice get staff to come and let out the water.   Most disappointed though that lying there in my bubble bath I could only see the tv through the plate glass divider as there was no sound.

Excellent hotel close to MRTs,"I had a great experience at the hotel. I was located on the 24th floor. It was a very quiet floor. Great view of city. The room was very clean and spacious. The hotel is close to three mrt stations so I was able to use public transportation on my visit. Between 10-15 minutes to get to marina bay sands, Little India and Chinatown.   Only issue was that the breakfast was very expensive. Maybe it would have been cheaper if I included it in the room charge, but it was sd$38.   Overall I would highly recommend this hotel.

Well located hotel in Singapore,"Located near Raffles City shopping mall, Carlton Hotel is a 3 minute walk away from the City Hall MRT (Red and Green lines). Hence it is pretty convenient to be based out of the hotel.   Plenty of food to be found in the mall and Chijmes is just across the road. Easy check in and check out.   Room was spacious and clean, overlooking the swimming pool. Usual amenities of bottled water, free wifi, TV,  bath tub and shower and toiletries.   Paid about SGD222 all in for a night.

We were in Singapore for just two days on the way to the Maldives and this was a great way to see the highlights.

We know there is better,"The location of this hotel is excellent, just across Raffles shopping center and the Chjmes. The rooms would be good in size and also feel in good state. However the setting seems gloomy. Lots of grey, kind of dark, not so positive. May be just the wrong design or different design. Had extremely loud neighbours with small kids, wonder if there is also an issue with noise insulation. Other people on the floor left 3-4 bags of garbage outside the door (instant noodles and fast food stuff), the issue is not was there for most of the day and completely diminished the perceived quality of the house.

Relaxing stay in Premier Room,We took a risk with the cheaper non refundable rates on a premier room having stayed at this hotel previously. Our room on the 16th floor overlooked the Raffles Hotel swimming pool with a great view of the Marina Bay area. The room could not be faulted although it can take a day or two the work out the shower controls. We walked the couple of blocks to Bugis a few times to take advantage the cheap. The one small complaint is that the Handy phone battery had given up (Management to note - Room 1677) and was no longer functional. The Australian TV channel allowed us to watch all the AFL games over the weekend. Check out the gym and pool if you are that way inclined.,40,Aug-19,Undisclosed,24,43,Carlton

Service-wise, there was no real fault at all. You're met on arrival, luggage taken to the room and check-in was fairly swift. The only thing some might have an issue with is that they do take a deposit. I personally didn't have a big problem with this and the deposit was about 275 SGD.

Location perfect ,Having used the Carlton for work and pleasure before. The location for the price in the centre of Singapore is one that can’t be beaten. Premium club rooms and the lounge are looking a little dated compared to other properties in the area. However the options are sufficient for pre dinner drinks and breakfast is adequate.  Lots is within walking distance and you can escape the humidity by walking through the numerous interlinked shopping malls. ,40,Jun-19,Travelled as a couple,17,35,Carlton

The room included a 4g phone free to use that meant we could also call home for free. With the bonus of having mobile internet and maps meant we didn’t get lost   Situated right next door to the raffles hotel and shopping and chjimes complex over the road meant we were never far from anything   Would definitely recommend and will return if we come back ,50,Jun-19,Travelled as a couple,59,61,Carlton

We arrived early in the morning and they were able to fit us into a room before our agreed check-in time.  We had a the room as seen in the photo but I have seen other more luxurious rooms that must be in the new tower block.  We were left bottles of water each day.

The hotel is very well located right across the road from Raffles, Raffles City mall and the Chijmes complex. It's also an easy walk from Bugis, Suntec City and Gardens by the Bay.   We stayed in an Executive Club Room, which offered us plenty of space for a cot (also supplied by the hotel) and a great view over the pool area. Room itself is comfortable and well-maintained, and the Handy smartphone was great to help us navigate the city and make free calls back home. Common facilities are also great, and we made particular use of the dedicated kids' pool.

The valet was our favourite and we loved his happy, friendly banter. The hotel is in an excellent location - a short walk to restaurants, bars and shops.

Poolside bar offers nice drinks.  Restaurants in the hotel attract large crowds on weekends.  The restaurant in the lobby offers a mix of Asian and Western dishes, with a great buffet for breakfast.

Being honest we really didn’t get to utilise the services available so could of used a cheaper hotel but glad we didn’t; with a late evening flight and a midday checkout our luggage was looked whilst we spent another 4-5 hours exploring the city and there are shower facilities you can use to freshen up before you depart, that was VERY nice. The smart phone in the room is handy if you take the time to learn how to use it, you can (apparently)hook up your phone to it rather than use local wifi; we used it for google maps mainly.",50,May-19,Travelled as a couple,63,54,Carlton

We had club lounge access and this was disappointing compared to other hotels we have stayed at.  It was only little things but there was absolutely no view of the city at all, food was very mediocre and the range of drinks limited.  They did not have their own kitchen so everything was brought up from elsewhere.  Hash browns even had to be cooked in the toaster - never heard of that before!

Premium Rooms no longer impress,"Having returned for the fourth year Carlton is a mixture of delight and disappointment. Staff are courteous and professional as ever, with complimentary upgrade. However, the rooms even in the Premium Wing are getting rather dated and tired. Loose marble tile on the side of the bath, no USB sockets (even local buses have them for a good two years). They removed the nice espresso machine from Premium Rooms but not bother to update their website. I was promised one as a courtesy but it didn't work. It really wan't worth being woken up for at 7.45am after a bad night's sleep. I rang twice about a replacement but nothing happened all morning. Spoke to the front desk directly at midday.

We visited twice and were generously upgraded on both occasions to luxury suites. Breakfast buffet is exciting and high quality with a selection of Asian and European foods.

I asked for an extra bed and declared that for a 5 star hotel this is what I would expect, like I did many times around the world. They explained that I should have specified it at the reservation (on their own site, there is no option for a third bed...) and that it was an extra 80 $ but anyhow they don’t have any available.

We arrived in Singapore early in the morning (6am)and I booked two nights so that we had access to a room when we arrived. The hotel is very comfortable and proved to be really convenient for our plan to spend the morning on the “hop on hop off” bus to get an overview of Singapore and the afternoon shopping. The bus terminal is only a few blocks walk and Raffles shopping centre (excellent) is across the road. Raffles Hotel is next door should you want to try a Singapore Sling. Our room was great for an overnighter....... the glass partition between the beds and bathroom is not a preference but happily the toilet had a frosted glass door (even after 40 years of marriage we like our privacy). I’ve been to Singapore…,40,Mar-19,Travelled as a couple,180,131,Carlton
Poor for this class of hotel,Was disappointed with the Carlton  Had to change room due to stale odour. Next room had nuts on the floor from previous guests. Coffee making facilities but no cups. Rooms are dark and could do with refresh. Pool area is small and breakfast is like a zoo. Not my best experience in Singapore ,20,Apr-19,Travelled on business,73,53,Carlton
Great location and beautiful rooms,Open bathrooms with enclosed toilet/shower with modern looks. Such a good location in between 2 different train line stops and just right next to Raffles City and Chijmes for great food + shopping. Might not even need to leave the vicinity to have fun.,50,Mar-19,Travelled with friends,31,13,Carlton
Excellent location,"It is located in a great area. I managed to walk and visit everything like Clarke quay, marina area, little India , China. I recommend it. Breakfast selection is wide, lots of fruits, all types of Coffee. You will not need lunch.",40,Mar-19,Travelled on business,104,67,Carlton
Good time !,"Now the check-n process was easy and very welcoming. We had a seven night stay here and our room was on level two, the room was long and large we did not have view from the room this did not both us in the least. The bathroom size was very good and in particular the shower was a generous size, lovely hot water and nice towels, there was a bath also in the bathroom.As for the toiletries I have to say these were impressive all contained ! The room was immaculate, plenty of storage space, a safe which was a very good size and plenty of wardrobe space, the king bed was comfortable had the best nights sleep! The Concierges were excellent very helpful with any enquirers.

A satisfactory first stay,"We been travelling to Singapore frequently and decided to choose this hotel for this recent trip to experience the services and accommodation of the hotel. It was our first time staying in this hotel and overall it was pleasant.  The room assigned to us was according to our request. Raffles shopping mall was just  200 metre short walk, hence very convenient for quick bites and meals.  The breakfast at mosaic was however mediocre hence, out for 3 nights stay, we only had breakfast once.   The internet was working well for emails and usual surfing for information but unsure if it is adequate enough for streaming movies.  Check out was a breeze especially as early as 5.50am in the morning. Also,  catching a taxi with two big suit cases and two small ones at the LOBBY without…",40,Mar-19,Travelled as a couple,705,190,Carlton
Excellent long stay for work,"Superb stay. Our whole group was very pleased with our stay for work. We received complimentary upgrades and good rates. Great location: bus stop outside the hotel, MRT stations nearby, plenty of great eating spots in walking distance. Fantastic staff. Highly recommend.",50,Mar-19,Travelled on business,13,4,Carlton
We’ll be Back,"The hotel is perfectly positioned in the heart of Singapore. We received a complementary upgrade and WOW, what a beautiful room. 24th floor and a view that is breathtaking. The most amazing bathroom where spending time in the morning was a pleasure😆. Have been to Singapore a number of times before but never explored so much before because of the location of our hotel.  The breakfast was very good considering the amount of people they serve. All hotel staff were friendly and attentive. Will definitely be returning. ",50,Feb-19,Travelled as a couple,6,6,Carlton
Top Location and great room,"Carlton Hotel is the best location in Singapore City, MRT within walking distant, Next to Chimjes, Raffles City Mall..  The room hotel is great, luxury bathroom style, nice beds, but the breakfast in 19th floor needs improvement for 5 Stars Hotel.. They cant serve egg benedicts, less option of the foods, but its more private area with beautiful scenery ( we can see the Marina Bay Sands and Singapore Flyer)",50,Mar-19,Travelled as a couple,457,161,Carlton
Recommended hotel,"We were pleased to be upgraded to an executive room. Check in and check out were smooth and efficient. In room wifi was very good. Very comfortable and well appointed room. Housekeeping of a high standard. The Carlton is opposite Raffles place where you can walk underground all the way to Suntec City.  I would recommend Grab rather than local taxis where the drivers nowadays just sit in the car and do not help passengers with luggage at all which is a distinct downer for tourists. Singapore is clean and safe but it is a ""fine"" city - there are fines for everything. The Carlton SIngapore is recommended, no complaints at all.",40,Mar-19,Travelled as a couple,92,52,Carlton
Couldn’t do more to make us happy!,"Location good, room large and well equipped, breakfast superb!!! Very glad we picked this hotel!  Public transport is close by with Buses & underground very reasonably priced. Everywhere is air conditioned and boy, do we need it! Singapore does ‘polite’ to extremes! No one rushes, cars do not speed, and people are very helpful. Only thing is you need to understand what they are saying!!",50,Mar-19,Travelled as a couple,63,38,Carlton
"Beautiful, well run hotel, near public transit and restaurants.","Enjoyed a wonderful 4 night stay at this hotel in a club room.  Room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Club lounge had a great daily breakfast and wine and snacks in the evening.   Public transportation is just out the door and the area is full of restaurants & bars.  Jacquelyn, who oversees the lobby staff, does a magnificent job and is a delight to meet.  We would stay at this hotel again.  Highly recommended.",50,Feb-19,Travelled as a couple,53,45,Carlton
Stay and shop,"Chose this hotel because it is near to the shopping places like Bugis, Raffles City, Suntec, Marina Bay Sands and the whole of Orchard Road is accessible by walking or MRT. Check in was a breeze.  We were early as we wanted to have lunch nearby but the room was already available.  However, the extra bed and amenities were not in yet but since we left for lunch, they were put up in the room during our absence.  However, they forgot about the extra mug but since one of us didn't need it, we didn't remind housekeeping. The room is spacious and could accommodate an extra bed. There are a lot of cupboards and shelves and I love the vanity table cum desk.  All my toiletries were out of sight when I closed the cover. It is my first experience with the toilet separated from the shower…",40,Mar-19,Travelled with family,252,86,Carlton
"Overally, good stay at Carlton Hotel Singapore. Clean, quiet. Good environment...","Mall, foods can be found in walking distance. Staff are friendly and helpful too. Importantly the room soundproof is good! Room is clean and is well maintain! Only down point, they have little TV channels, but it is still good for us as we barely spend too long hours in hotel room.",40,Mar-19,Travelled with family,4,0,Carlton
Excellent,"Stayed here for four nights in late February.  The hotel is well positioned probably about 4 minutes walk from two MRT stations.  We were in a Club room so had use of that facility which was undoubtedly a bonus.  The lounge was quite large and although there were a lot of people there at times, service was always excellent.  Our room was quite spacious and housekeeping excellent.  In fact, the service provided by all staff was at a very high level.  While this is a busy hotel, both check in and check out were seamless.  I can't really think of one thing about this hotel on which I could comment negatively.  If I return to Singapore, this would be my choice for hotel accommodation",50,Feb-19,Travelled as a couple,52,42,Carlton
Great Staff,"Excellent hotel perfect position and what impressed us most was the staff...although there was a mix up on our inclusive breakfast that got sorted all ok....the breakfast buffet all food covered, very comfortable bed.",40,Mar-19,Travelled with family,202,82,Carlton
Very good location ,"I love this location!! You won’t feel bored at all.  City hall station is just next to me, Chijmes just across the street. And they provided handy in the room, I ordered room service at 2am.  Outdoor swimming pool and gym are at 5/F.   I don’t even need to go Sentosa beach for suntan.  Very recommended!!",50,Mar-19,Travelled on business,30,12,Carlton
"Top location, room a bit average","Stayed here for a couple of nights in a premier club room which we thought was quite small for the price we paid. On entering  our room we quickly noticed a smell that we thought was stale urine in the bathroom which was horrendous. This disappeared after we flushed the sink, bath, and shower with water for a few minutes. There was also a four pack of kim chee the housemaids had left us in the minibar, yuck! Apart from that the hotel was in top condition, clean, and staff were friendly and helpful. The club on the 19th floor was a nice quiet place to relax while we had our complimentary canapes and drinks  while admiring the view of the city. ",40,Mar-19,Travelled as a couple,173,90,Carlton
Just fine. ,"The location is my favorite feature of this hotel.  It's right in front of Chijmes which is full of options to eat and also across a mall. Several bus stops are within the area so it's also very easy to go around.   Only thing that bothered me a little was the layout of the room. When you enter you are immediately greeted by the bathroom sink on your right side. Kind of bizarre as it doesn't really have a partition.   Anyway, it was ok but for the price you can get larger rooms with adequate cabinets. Our room didn't have one and you may obly hang your clothes through an open rod.   Service is okay. ",30,Mar-19,Travelled on business,258,28,Carlton
City hotel,"This is a well priced city hotel, easy access to everything and very friendly and helpful staff. The rooms are clean and well sized - ask for a nice view and the city view is stunning. Even the door man is lovely with a great sense of humour......this all makes for a pleasant stay.",50,Mar-19,Travelled as a couple,57,37,Carlton
Good location hotel,"I stayed here during 2018 Christmas in the nice view room on high floor. The room was really good, can't really blame anything. There was a bit of confusion with the room clean but the receptionist handled it perfectly. Just the breakfast, I stayed here for 3 nights but the morning buffet does not change much.",40,Dec-18,Travelled as a couple,11,6,Carlton
Nice functional hotel,"This is a nice hotel. The room is reasonably sized, the bed was comfortable, and the hotel is well located in an area with plenty of shopping malls and ‘heritage’ walks around the older buildings of Singapore.  The hotel would be well suited for business travellers (it has a large business centre and good gym) and families.",40,Mar-19,Travelled as a couple,67,11,Carlton
Great Hotel To Stay,"Stayed 3 nights in this hotel with good sleeping quality and room environment. Great service since the umbrella to be borrowed while raining. Great breakfast, lunch and tea time. Easy access to shopping mall, food places and others historical place.",40,Jan-19,Travelled on business,42,4,Carlton
Great service in a comfortable hotel,"I booked a one night stay prior to a cruise out of Singapore, followed by a further 3 night stay at the end of the cruise. Firstly, the staff at front desk were amazing. Smartly dressed, very polite and efficient and nothing too much trouble. Check-in was seamless and we scored an upgrade on the one night stay- bonus! On our return for the 3 night stay, we were checked in very early without any hassle- very grateful for this.  Our room on both occasions was lovely. We were upgraded to the Premier Club room that we booked for the second part of our stay. The room was spacious and very comfortable. Best of all was the Sealy bed. We generally find Asian hotels favour beds a little too firm for our taste so it was great to have a comfy bed. Also of note were the micogel pillows 😀So…",50,Feb-19,Travelled as a couple,107,53,Carlton
Premier Rooms are fantastic,"Room was large and airy with the window capable of being opened. Room came with a King Size bed and the staff ensured that it was always neat and tidy. Access to a large bathroom with a walk in shower plus a bath. Amenities included a TV, Refrigerator and Air Conditioning. Because of the Premier Room access was granted to the Premier Lounge where one could have breakfast and dinner. Drinks were included Staff were always helpful and very obliging.",50,Mar-19,Travelled with family,379,119,Carlton
Very nice hotel in central location ,The Carlton hotel is situated fairly well right across raffles hotel and the long bar and a large shopping centre. There is an MRT close by and you can also jump on the hop on hop off bus again just across the road.   The hotel reception is very grand and the staff are very friendly and helpful all speaking very good English.   We were upgraded to a premier room which had more space and a great view out to the city towards marina bay. The room itself had all you should expect with modern decor.   As we were only in Singapore 3 days we didn’t get the chance to use many of the hotel facilities and the many restaurants.   We did use the pool small but what you would expect from an inner city hotel.   Enjoyable stay would recommend. ,40,Feb-19,Travelled as a couple,76,46,Carlton
Amazing Hotel and great customer service ,"We stayed here for a couple of nights before we left to Sidney, Australia. When we arrived the porters immediately unloaded the suitcases from our van. We checked in and our we asked for an upgrade to a premium room. The room had a fantastic view of the city.   The location of the hotel was perfect. The On and Off Bus was very close to the hotel. There were plenty of shops and places to eat around the hotel. The hotel provided Nespresso machines with three capulets.  The bathroom was extremely luxurious with so much room. The tub was enclosed by glass and looks into the room. Very impressive. They provided slippers and a robe.   On the day we left, the hotel provided showers and an area to freshen up before our red eye flight to Sidney.   I highly recommend this hotel. Great…",50,Feb-19,Travelled with family,54,20,Carlton
Carlton Hotel/Singapore Restaurants,Stayed here 3rd year in a row and the concierge Ali and doorman Yunus were fantastic as always and very helpful. Wah Lok restaurant has great food for dinner and may be somewhat pricey but very good and also excellent service from the staff. Tried chilli crab at Restaurant With No Brand at Geylang and nice crab but very pricey and would not be going there again as I would rather pay the same amount and get excellent food and service at Wah Lok even though food is different but chilli crab is chilli crab and very small serving for the price and SGD30 for a plate of palin vegetables!!!,40,Feb-19,Travelled with family,30,5,Carlton
Nice view and near mrt,"First time travelled with the 2 kids, me and my wife choose this hotel. When we arrived the hotel, they give us check in early. Thank you very much. The room very clean and nice view. Only the bathroom a bit small, my wife had a trouble when bathed the kids. Breakfast at the lounge was wonderful with the good view, especially the chinese lady staff Rebecah. She was very friendly and good with the kids. The foods was nice, the porridge very nice.

Great hotel. Free upgrade,I went there for my wedding anniversary last week and it was amazing. Loved the hotel. The location was awesome. Staffs were great. My wife and I both had a good time.

Luxury hotel which gives us a feel like home,"It was one of the best hotel in Singapore as we were hosted by Peter Chua (Front Office Manager), He was very attentive in anything during our stay in Carlton hotel. If you need more informations about the hotel and surrounding or any helps to get transport or things to discover in Singapore, then he is the man. The room was nice, tidy and comfort, the room is also facilitated with handy (smart phone) which I found so useful as I just stayed one night in town (no singapore SIM card needed) and I love the fact that they provide Nespresso coffee machine with the variety of capsules (I could get my afternoon/morning coffee just in my room) And not forget to mention the premium collection of toiletries and good quality of bathrobe is one of my favorites too.

The check in was fabulous which they allowed us to get into our room earlier than the normal check in time 14.00.

From the airport, you just need to take the train to Tanah Merah and then transfer to the green line to Tuas Link. Just get off the train on the 9th stop (City Hall). The hotel is just a block away.   The room that I got was spacious. Separate bath tub and shower. Comfortable bed. Free wifi. They also have a handy phone that you can use. Free local calls. Free data 4G. There’s a minimal fee if you want to use the handy phone as a personal hotspot. The gym was okay. It has a small sauna. The pool was nice.

Christmas,Checked I  just after Christmas day.  There was still a festive atmosphere and the lobby was tastefully decorated. The rooms were large and luxurious. The breakfast was ample and tasty although it felt a little like a canteen.   Probably because of the volume of people due to the ime of year.   Would definitely stay again.  Hotel central to most attractions,50,Dec-18,Travelled as a couple,145,42,Carlton
Very poor service ,"I checked in to find the hot water wasn’t working in my room. After unpacking I was then told I needed to change rooms. I asked for an upgrade for the inconvenience and was actually moved to a smaller room. Very poor communication from management and finally an offer to move, for a second time to a new and bigger room. For a four star hotel in Singapore with many other options I was very disappointed with accountability from management and problem solving. I won’t stay here again.

Good central location and hotel facilities ,"We stayed here for 4 nights, from New Year’s Eve. When we arrived, the hotel had another group in the rooms (I assume to make extra $ from New Year’s Eve patrons) so we could not check in until 10pm.   The staff were apologetic but I think this was a poor decision on the management side just to make extra dollars. From a 7hr flight we had to wait another 5hrs to checkin to a room we had prebooked and paid for months in advance. They did offer us compensation of a room upgrade and a bottle of wine for this inconvenience.   Apart from that issue, the hotel staff were attentive and the hotel was modern clean and close to most attractions such as Chinatown, Maxwell Hawker Centre and other attractions.

My only criticisms are that the concierge is not tremendously helpful (it took quite a bit of dialog to get clear directions, and their restaurant recommendations did not jibe with online reviews), and there seems to be no way to say 'don't change the sheets and towels everyday to save water'.

Nice Hotel,The staff were very attentive to my needs.  Service was excellent.  The position of the Carlton is convenient for the MRT which is the easiest way to to get around Singapore but if taxis are required these are easily obtained by the hotel.

Decent enough hotel,"Had to stay at the Carlton when a flight was cancelled. I thought the staff were great, and they knew exactly what they were doing given the very short notice they must have had in sorting our rooms out.  The rooms were decent enough, quite dated but ok. Breakfast was average, but made up for my an excellent choice at dinner.  For a midrange 5* (ie 4 star) you may want to consider the Carlton ",40,Oct-18,Travelled solo,110,123,Carlton

I got a number for a girl who found the phone - he phoned her, get her to wait outside her house for me and then arranged a taxi driver to take me there and use his personal phone to phone the girl when I arrived.

In spite of being next to the lifts it was blissfully quiet.  The bathroom was well equipped but thank goodness for the privacy blind to the shower to spare our collective blushes.  The beds were very comfortable and we slept soundly.  Our room overlooked the pool which we made good use of.  In terms of position it really is very central and within easy walking distance of public transport and a variety of shops and restaurants.  On a negative note, the instant coffee provided…",40,Aug-18,Travelled with family,19,21,Carlton
Good location to MRT stations but uncomfortable pillows,"I stayed in a deluxe twin room for 4 nights. A very good location for getting to different MRT lines. Decent breakfast if you're not looking for a Le Méridien kind of spread. Attentive and friendly staffs. Only thing I'm not satisfied is the pillows. They are uncomfortable to me. I have not request for a new pillow so I'm not sure if it would be any different if I did. Overall, pleasant experience. ",40,Aug-18,Travelled solo,167,14,Carlton

2nd visit a disappointment ,"We stayed in the Carlton in February and were really impressed by the quality, customer service and high standard of this hotel. This stay influenced my decision to return to the Carlton as I loved the hotel. Unfortunately this time, our visit left us underwhelmed.   We arrived at 5 pm and had 2 rooms booked. I had emailed the hotel and requested both rooms on the same high floor with king beds. When we checked in, we were offered twin rooms but on different floors. After mentioning our request we were finally given king rooms on the same floor but only one room was available as the other was still being cleaned.

They didn't offer to take bags to the room and watched me struggle with a large suitcase with a broken wheel on checking in and I had to lug it across the foyer to get into the lift The lobby is a good seating area to work but no staff ever ask if you'd like a drink.

For Those With Gluten Intolerance...,"This Hotel would have received 5 stars were it not for the fact that the food choices were extremely limited for those with gluten intolerance issues. In fact, if you are gluten intolerant/celiac, then be prepared to spend a lot of time researching where you can eat or bring your own food. There is a great deal of ignorance in Singapore with regard to this issue. It’s a pity as it makes visiting here much harder than it needs to be.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"The hotel was good but I was expecting more from the service and the room itself is just ok given the price and my window view is not good too. I went out for lunch but when I came back the room was not fixed, she only gave me a towel for replacement. I told her just to go back at 5:45 because I have dinner at 6 but she is 20 min early and so she was cleaning while Im still inside the room. The cleaner was polite and corteous and I noticed she was alone cleaning too many rooms. Maybe thats why she was lacking of time so she needs to do everything out of schedule (late or ahead). Some peeps on the concierge were nice and some were not and inefficient. No photos haha didn't took any. Nothing interests me.",30,Jul-18,Travelled on business,3,4,Carlton

Fabulous central place to stay,This motel was an unknown (a guess) we were both pleasantly surprised. Our room was lovely with lots of space. We paid the extra money for the club room and are so glad we did. The staff were wonderful and helpful. The club room was great and had a great view from the balcony towards MBS and the city skyline.  Our whole experi nice of this supposedly 4 star motel was 5 star service. We didn’t fly out until 9pm and they arranged for us to have a 6pm checkout. Service plus in our opinion.  They have a pool and a spa and there were children there if you have a young family. Easy access for cabs and buses within walking distance. Would definitely recommend this motel to anyone. 10/10 for sure,50,Jul-18,Travelled as a couple,10,2,Carlton

Short Business Trip,Stayed here for 3 nights in July while on business. More than adequate hotel from accommodation point of view with decent pool and gym as well.  The business centre was a bit basic and felt like you were stepping back in time in terms of facilities.

"Beautiful studio room, but subpar service a disappointment","Stayed in a studio room for two nights in preparation for our wedding at a church in the vicinity. The room itself was clean and spacious, beautifully laid out and with excellent views of the city from the bedroom and bathroom windows, while the breakfast spread on both mornings was tasty and varied. Despite the beautiful room, service was subpar in comparision from the moment we stepped into the hotel.

Travel in Style,"Worst experience and false marketing. The worst hotel we have ever stayed in. We stayed two nights in this hotel on our way to and from Vietnam so experienced two different rooms, one basic and the other Premium Club. On the 'basic' side the room was standard, painted neutral, no artwork, no kettle, coffee or tea, bar fridge had one Beer and some soft drinks. Pool Bar was pretty ordinary. We went out for dinner! On our return Premium Club promised Cocktails and Canapés as part of the room cost. This is false marketing and on arrival at the Premium Club Lounge dressed to code, we were greeted by a gentleman who asked for our room number and what would we like to drink. I asked for a Martini and my husband for a Lemon, lime and bitters. Oh no we cannot make either of those drinks.…",10,Jun-18,Travelled as a couple,25,5,Carlton

The hotel also provides a mobile phone in the room, which you can use to make local calls and access the Internet while you’re out and about (think Google Maps).  It’s not the cheapest hotel out there, but it certainly exceeded my expectations. Most of these 5 star hotels are the same, but this one goes just that little extra mile.

I like Carlton because it is located away from busy malls and subways yet close enough for easy access so there is privacy and convenience. I am not sure how the standard rooms are because it is a pretty old hotel. But I wish the operator can do a better job at being nice. She was quite grumpy on the line.

Love Singapore BUT..,"Thought we would try a new hotel this visit. Priority in our choosing is always the location.  We prefer the Raffles area as close to many things including good access to brilliant train system. The room design is off putting with open bathroom as you walk in.   No enclosed robes so your hanging clothes visible.    No block out curtains, just see thru type.   In the afternoon and evening the sun streams thru and makes it difficult to see TV. We had need to call ""Engineering:"" for three issues, one is a design fault with the shower.   Don't use the ""rain"" shower head as water will leak into toilet area.

We paid the extra to be in the Club room which was so worth it.  The breakfast was wonderful, as is the view from the lounge area.  The drinks and canapes were more than worth it.

Huge, with a massive bathroom which included a bathtub and shower. However our second room we were given for our April stay was about half the size in comparison. There was no bathtub, not even any bathrobes in the room. This was a disappointment as we only booked a return stay based on our first experience.

We ordered room service and the food was surprisingly top-notch. Service was solid. Our pre-booking for a day-use room went on without a hitch and staff were friendly.   We are already thinking of when we can book another stay! This four-star hotel surely over performs on expectations.  Room tip: choose the studio rooms, which are well worth the upgrade.

"Very disappointing, poor performance, no ambiance.","We came by to see if we would stay in this hotel. In the lobby (some chairs were dirty) we ordered two tea. Our regular choice (Rooibos) was not available. The ambiance was poor and it was very quiet, nevertheless it took more then 10 minutes for serving two tea pots and two ordinary cookies. In the meanwhile I visited the restrooms where I found a dirty smell and a wet floor, certainly not of cleaning. We decided not to stay and asked for the bill. We paid ~ Euro 25,00. No tip, no value for money.  We were happy that two people opened the door when leaving the hotel. Yes, that was full service but too late. ",20,Mar-18,Travelled as a couple,69,49,Carlton

Large Room Great Location,My partner and I with our 4 year old stayed here for 2 nights in an executive room with buffet breakfast. The room was king size and bed comfortable. Breakfast was really big.   We took the train from the airport as the taxi line was massive. It cost us less than $5! We got off at city hall and walked out and our hotel was right there. Great location a lot of shopping malls.  Suggest to use Bras Basah MRT if your going to the Singapore Flyer or marina bay. We got a big lost walking to the esplanade MRT thru city hall.   Taxi are very cheap. It was $20 to go to jurong bird park which was 20min drive ,50,Feb-18,Travelled with family,37,29,Carlton
Excellent .............!!,Stopped off here for two days on the way to NZ. I found the staff excellent and super friendly in what is a really nice hotel. It is ideally situated next to Raffles Hotel ( closed till end of the year ) and a large shopping centre with a fantastic food court. Within the shopping centre is a station for the metro which is the easiest and hassle free way to get around the sights of Singapore. A very relaxing and enjoyable stay was had so I would have no hesitation in staying here again or recommending it to others.,40,Feb-18,Travelled as a couple,19,49,Carlton
Top Job Carlton,"This was not your average hotel visit.  It had been intended to be a quick 2 night stay with our sons, before heading back to Europe.

Couldn’t do more for us.,"This is one of those reviews that could easily have gone the other way, lol. Having been on the go for nearly 12 hours we arrived at the hotel and checked in, it being the Chinese New Year it was obviously very busy but this didn’t really cause any issues as the reception staff were very professional. We noted that we were missing a bed in our room (we had paid for 2 adults and one <12 child).  Wife called reception and was originally told that their were no additional beds (Chinese NY) and the best they could do was a blanket and pillow for the floor or 3 in a bed!

Avoidable.,"Lazy Service. The patisserie would shut down before time for no reason. Choice of vegetarian food was very poor and the staff were not inclined to help. If you are vegetarian, take the room without a breakfast option since you will have a choice of a few things in the buffet. We shifted to Intercontinental afterwards and that had a great spread in breakfast. Replenishment of coffee and tea and toilet rolls was random in the rooms. most hotel even though they block your card, let you pay by cash. They refused outright in this case. Other colleagues who stayed in the same hotel (same booking rate) got better rooms with bath tubs, etc. We got the worst lot of two rooms.",20,Feb-18,Undisclosed,49,21,Carlton

Check in was quick with the check in lady rattling off information like a speeded up robot , so fast we couldn't understand what she was saying!

Room was quite pleasant, bright and clean but with open bathroom area , whats with these hotels with all these open glassed in areas with no proper privacy? There was no wardrobe, just a hanging rail which was not ideal. The worst thing about this hotel is the breakfast dining room!

GOOD VALUE HOTEL,"My family and I stayed for 2 nights (which included New Years Eve) on our way to Europe.  I tried booking some other hotels in Singapore, but their rates were ridiculously high over New Year’s Eve.  The rates at the Carlton Hotel were very good, so I went ahead and booked this hotel.  The location of the hotel is excellent.  My son and I used the gym, and I would rate it as a very good hotel gym.  The hotel has an outdoor swimming pool.  However, we found the water temperature to be a bit cold, probably because it was located between two buildings and didn’t seem to get much sunlight.

A hotel that needs to review its kitchens,The Carlton hotel is a bit of a quandary to assess.  It’s rooms are spacious and although a little needing of a refit are still of a good quality for this 4 Star Hotel.  The facilities are good as well with a fairly well appointed gym and pool.  What is disappointing is that this hotel was once well known for its buffet and menu.  It was once a place where local residents would go for a buffet in the past.  Much like the Shangri-La Hotel Line restaurent today.  When you rate a hotel the standard of its buffet and menus are an essential part of that assessment.  For this reason I have given a hotel that should get a 4 in all rights as a 4 Star Hotel the rating of a 3.  The buffet was poorly thought out.

The coffee shop in the lobby is quite enough for a short business meeting and good quality is decent.   Rooms are average size for Singapore.I found the bed mattress and pillows too soft. Bathroom was small. Room service menu does not have too many vegetarian options. Breakfast was a decent spread each day.   Overall a decent 4 star hotel and decent value for the price you pay.   ,40,Sep-17,Travelled on business,74,91,Carlton
Great choice of accommodation ,"This is a really well located hotel. One block away from the MRT station and 5 minute walk to the Bugis markets. Maps were provided when requested and the concierge took the time to point out areas of interest. On the adjacent corner is a great shopping centre too and in the basement there is a money changer. Rate was ok but it was a tad cheaper at the airport.  The rooms are a great size and quite modern. I was disappointed that although we were staying 2 nights, Milk & sugar was only provided for one night. Not a big problem but it takes a while for room service to arrive.  The pool area was really nice and I really wished we had more time there to use the pool.  When we checked in, they took $100 from my card for incidentals which wasn’t returned when checking out. They tell…",40,Jan-18,Travelled with family,38,15,Carlton
"Great hotel, poor patron behaviour","This is the second time I have stayed here at the carlton hotel and once again my review is mixed and therefore would be unlikely to return. Firstly Thank you to the hotel for upgrading my room on our honeymoon, the room was modern and had spectacular views. Unfortunately on both nights we stayed, it looked like our room was surrounded by tour groups who were there to party and this went onto into.the early hours of the morning on both nights. Whilst this was necessarily the hotels fault, staff would drop by to drop of food and didn't really address the matter.

"Not five star - but nice, clean, excellent location, superior service","I recently stayed one night at Carlton on a business trip.  It seems to be a quasi touristy and business hotel around mid- to lower upper range.  the entry is large and spacious but not overly zealous like the casinos  All around, service is attentive and friendly.  The rooms are decent size, in the four star range - not new or lush, but quite nice, clean, etc.  there seems to be a pool and spa here, but i didn't visit.

Plenty of places to visit and eat at all through the day and night, right out outside. Hotel itself is very clean, rooms are spacious and service is solid. Shower is strong.

Best beds in Singapore ,"We only had one night here after a couple of weeks in Thailand.  We were made welcome from the minute we arrived. The reception desk arranged a late check out for us to coincide with our flight. The room was spacious and the bed and pillows were like sleeping on a cloud. That with the blockout curtains, we had the best night sleep in ages.  The hotel is well located, close to the underground train station and shopping malls.  There was also the use of a complementary mobile phone.  You could take the phone out with you, it had free unlimited internet (great for looking up maps while out and about) and we also could make free unlimited phone calls back to Australia (land lines only) That was just the icing on the cake.  We would definitely stay there again next time we come back…",50,Jan-18,Travelled with family,149,61,Carlton
Busy hotel but brilliant location ,"We used the Carlton Hotel as our base for 7 nights in Singapore. It’s a busy business style hotel but in a convenient location. Right across the road from CHIJMES, a 3 minute walk to the MRT and 10 minutes to Suntec City (arguably the best shopping complex in Singapore), you can’t get much more ‘located’ than this.   Rooms are modern and comfortable with blackout curtains that can create the extra sleep time you may need after a night out. Staff were very friendly and the hotel as a whole was exceptionally clean. We will return to Singapore and will look at staying here again or at the Marriott (close by) to be in the location. ",40,Jan-18,Travelled as a couple,70,78,Carlton

Breakfast has all the usual suspects that you would expect from a club floor. The coffee is not too bad for a hotel coffee machine,and the lovely staff will always get you one . the toaster is dreadful and often burnt one side of the toast.(why can't hotels ever get their toasters right ? ) cold stringy bacon ,some asian foods and an unimpressive buffet, THERE ARE NO CONDIMENTS TO BE SEEN,why are there no sauces or condiments ??and I had to ask for pepper and salt shakers.

In reality not all Premier rooms have that view. Luckily after the first night the staff found another room for us with gorgeous view. Access to the Club Lounge is a nice experience especially for happy hour as you can have food and drinks basically replacing the dinner. The gym was ok but the swimming pool was very small. So don’t count on swimming there if only for dipping like many people do after the gym without even taking shower! The breakfast was ok, we liked the fruits selection.

We know that some guests would only wake up at 9:00 am so to have a room ready for us at that time of the day and of the year was just amazing. Secondly, we were up-graded from left tower to Premium Tower with a generous size room. It is a shame we cannot recall the Receptionist name, he should have his name mentioned on Trip Advisor under outstanding service category.  We rented a car from the airport so we needed a car park space which came for free, under one condition: to grab a bar coded pass from Concierge for every exit.

A free smartphone is an unusual but handy extra in all rooms!   Had a Studio Room, with a free-standing bathroom as big as the room and with an excellent view of the city.

I booked this hotel for a guest overseas. Due to some accident he couldn’t check in on the original date and so i went to check in instead. Upon checking in i was told i needed an email verification from him in order to check in EVEN THOUGH i was the one who paid for and booked the hotel.

The Great Indifference,"The feeling we took away from our weekend at the Carlton was one of indifference - from the reservations to the check-in to the room service.   The tone is that of casual disinterest. You ask for X and they will give you X but with very few niceties. It puts the ""business"" in the ""business hotel"".  It is a pity as I recall service was a lot better years ago when we held our wedding banquet at the hotel.   This is also why we decided to have a family staycation there around the time of my wedding anniversary. I told the reservations the reason for my stay while booking. A more attentive hotel would have given us a wedding anniversary greeting during our check-in.  Sure, the location is great and the room is clean but it was really the details that let down.

Service here was lovely but the choice of breakfast was limited and never changing, as were the evening snacks, more meal than accompaniments to drinks.

2nd Stay at the Carlton Hotel,"My husband and I had a stay in late September at the Carlton hotel for 6 nights. This is our second stay here, the first being 4 years ago in 2013.  We again chose to stay in a Premier room - although the other wing has now been renovated (it was not when we stayed 4 years ago!) we enjoyed this room last time so went with it again.   The hotel was nice enough to grant my request for a high floor with a view out to marina bay - the room number was 1869 - you can definitely catch the left side of Marina Bay sands from the room window.

Nice hotel in a good location,"The Carlton Hotel is quite nice and in a central location. The lobby was a great place to meet with colleagues and always had a bit of buzz going on. The rooms were nice. Not huge but had all of the features that I require. It's a fairly large hotel, but you never had to wait for an elevator.   The only problem I had was that the gym and pool area didn't open until 7AM. That doesn't work for those on business as you don't have enough time to work out before the day starts. The one time I was able to get to the gym, I found it to be nice and well equipped.   Because not getting into the gym before work is a deal-breaker for me, I likely wouldn't stay here again.

Several years ago the Carlton hotel was extended by the construction of the new tower, which the hotel refers to as its premier wing. This is certainly a good place to stay in.

The Premier Club Room is spread across 34sq.m. and was appointed suitably well. The room that we were offered however looked onto the rear side of an adjacent building thereby denying us of any interesting views. I found that especially odd, since the staff remarked to me that since it was a long weekend, they weren't as busy. We were booked in to stay for five nights and I thought the hotel would use it's discretion to offer a better view for guests staying that long.

very pleasant stay,"nice room, bed and pillow are comfortable, i got to sleep very well. i got a room that faces the other (older) block and also the swimming pool, i didnt find that an issue, and i think perhaps room facing inside are more quiet. spacious room and good seating spots. breakfast has been the same for the three days of my stay, cant complain much, they taste good. shopping and eating is just across the street. wide selection too, there is a building with some used/second hand book stores, worth a visit if you like books, some craft store and art galleries there too",50,Aug-17,Travelled on business,25,6,Carlton
Understated and practical,"Hotel exterior and interior itself is nothing grand nor glamorous - the room is understated in design, cosy and practical for business trips.  I stayed for a full week business trip - and found everything I needed and indeed feel quite at home.   It is not your luxurious hotel but their service is outstanding - the staff go the extra miles, very polite and they do service from the heart - without hesitation.  One of the room service waiter came in and accidentally stepped on my slipper, it was not a big deal, but he made the effort to bring me back a new pair.  I struggled to connect my USB driver to play my movies on their TV - turns out it was a set model and does not have that function.  The engineer who came to fix it came back within five minutes, and to my surprise, he…",50,Aug-17,Travelled on business,280,124,Carlton
Comfortable hotel in the heart of Singapore,"Very good hotel in the heart of Singapore. International standard. Asian service. Pool is OK but not the best if you plan to combine pool time with visits. Booking systems were down when we arrived. We we asked to wait. One hour later, nothing had changed.

An perfectly ran exotic getaway with all amenities you would expect from a top hotel,"I could not make myself leave their amazing pool!   I've stayed there for a few days and it was one of the best experiences in my life.  Love it. Will go back again. The elevator on the side of the building with a clear panoramic wall was a bit scary for I am afraid of the heights. Only thing I did not like- we had a medical emergency happened to us but hotel did not have a medically trained personnel to attend to us. But they did put me on a line with Singaporean hospital and I followed the directions and sorted the situation out myself.

Usual high standard,Same high standard that I have come to expect from the Carlton. A stay in the 'new' tower with a view over Raffles was nice. The proximity to the lift seemed as if it would be a noisy hassle but wasn't. Breakfast was good. Check In and Out was painless and ease of getting a taxi was good. Proximity to local venues is always good and only half the price of other nearby hotels!,40,Jul-17,Travelled on business,12,8,Carlton
"Nice room, need to refurbish some parts. Excellent location","Carlton located at a very central area with short distance to Orchard road, to Marina Bay and other parts.

Cleanliness of room need to be improved though the cleaner maid is a nice woman. Room acoustic is not so good, people with louder voice was easily be heard at next room or at corridor. Room design is simply and comfort. Overall staffs are nice and helpful, in-room food service is good and tasteful.  In conclude, this is a average rating hotel at this price but if a buffet breakfast was included, it should be a plus mark.",30,Aug-17,Travelled with family,11,3,Carlton

Used Uber a lot and picks and drop offs were no problem with an average wait of 5 min. Avg price around town was a little under $10. MRT and plenty of food options just across the road (including a small supermarket in the raffles mall basement.

Pros - great location, comfy bed, great price compared to what we have paid in the past at the Fairmont and Swissotel across the road. Smart phone is a good move plus we didn't need our adaptor. Smart thinking Carlton. Overall, I found it better value for money.  Cons - still trying to work out where the power point in the bathroom was. I ended up doing my hair at the desk. Strange. Staff at the pool bar had no idea where the sauna is. Found it after checking TripAdvisor. The staff need to smile more.

Singapore perfect,"Locally run Carlton hotel is a great example of ""hometown service""-- efficiently run with minimal fuss or presumption, but with high quality for price. Check-in and out was a breeze for us even though there are lots of tour groups from China.   Yes there are more expensive and cheaper rooms in Singapore, but in my opinion, the value for money is high here especially compared to the Raffles Hotel next door.  The location in the Civic center is close to 3 different MRT stations/Lines (City Hall, Bugis, and Bras Basah), providing easy access to Orchard shopping, Marina Bay shows, or Little India eating.  Lots of high end or lower end eating at Chimes across the street or the food court at the bottom of Raffles City Mall.

Perfect Location,Stayed for 2 nights. Situated at the back of The Raffles Hotel. Was upgraded to the premier wing - lovely room. Big bathroom. The Smart phone they give you is brilliant for google maps & researching things to do.  The location is perfect to use the MRT which is so cheap & easy to use.  We ate at The Raffles City food court & also at Chijmes which is so beautiful at night with the lights on the church. Sat by the pool for a swim & cocktails - just push the buzzer & a waiter arrives to take your order.  Would definitely stay again. ,50,Aug-17,Travelled as a couple,36,14,Carlton

We were very happy with our choice. The Carlton is very well located at the junction of Bras Basah and North Bridge Roads, across the road from Chijmes restaurant complex, Raffles Hotel and Raffles Shopping Centre. City Hall MRT is a short walk away and the National Gallery and Asian Civilisations Museum are also within easy walking distance.

Taxis are also very cheap and easy to pick up at the front door. I don't understand the criticisms about customer service and checking in and out - if you arrive as part of a large party, it will take longer to check in, but for couples and solos, there is no delay, unless half a plane-load of couples have arrived at the same time.  After all, one cannot expect walk into a hotel or shop and expect to find someone just waiting to serve ""me"". Similarly, I don't understand the comment the breakfast package.

Very happy. I would come back.,After travelling for 4 weeks it was refreshing to come to a real 4 star hotel. It is a busy hotel and the staff work very hard to ensure your comfort. Breakfast is a feast to behold. The rooms are very well appointed and comfortable. It's central location makes it easy to get around to many of the sights by foot and the public transport system and tourist bus stop is close. Raffles is next door for your Singapore sling hit. ,40,Aug-17,Travelled solo,59,41,Carlton
Poor customer service at the reception ,The hotel is good and it's location is also very close to most of the attractions. However the biggest issue is with the check in and check out process. It just takes forever. There are not many people at the reception and I had to wait for about 15 minutes during checking in and about 30 mins while checking out. It's just frustrating to see the speed at which the staff does the processing.,20,Aug-17,Travelled on business,200,100,Carlton

At hotel, if you take hot noodles, you need to pay 11 SGD more than bread food. This is ridiculous. If you take one bread and one noodle, SGD 33.if you take only bread , it is SGD 22.

Large flat screened TVs internet access at an extra charge for the room but plenty of free places within the hotel the bathroom was luxury incarnated.

The pool is a bit small, but located in a cool middle-of-the-tower location that gets nice breezes. So overall, the Carlton is a great place, and somewhere I'd consider staying again.   On the down side, it is clear that the management of the hotel is looking to make it a tech-forward location, but not really being successful at it. There's a mobile phone in the room.

Not the best as far as service and response is concerned,"We stayed here 13-15th July 2017. The hotels' location is its best attribute. The rooms are fairly large open and airy, There is no covered wardrobe only an open closet so in effect the room looks messy as soon as you enter as all your clothes are hanging there. So also the hand was area which is open and outside the bath area- so as soon as you enter the room you see ones personal stuff all over the place which is very embarrassing if you have a visitor.  My personal experience was not the greatest as I had to move my 21 year old son to my room as a third occupant as he was very ill. 1.

We stayed in 2230 and our room, at the end of the corridor, looked directly into another building (about 1.5-2m) away. I think the bathroom was good with a bath, shower and toilet but with full windows, you had to put the blinds fully down to get privacy, even for the toilet. The bedroom area was not large, but comfortable. Location, as others has said, it excellent, but having stayed also at the Swissotel The Stamford which is across the road for a similar price, I wouldn't choose to stay here again.

A bonus was opening windows. Tea and coffee in the room was very limited and the TV was not worth watching. Staff were friendly and helpful. The Club lounge was very good. The drinks and food were plentiful but perhaps a bit limited in variety.  We had two free items for laundry every day which was excellent.

The only fault I had was the little children racing around the large reception area, skidding on the highly polished floor.  Parents don't seem to discipline their children.  Beautiful breakfast with anything you could want.  Nice pool, however its a bit small, being in Singapore, everyone wants to use it and there is no room for swimming laps.

And it was also easy to reach several nearby MRT stations such as Bras Basah, City Hall, Esplanade, and Bugis, and several bus stops. For the room and services provided, both are great. The room was neat and clean, the bed was comfortable, the shower had above-your-head sprinkles, the shampoo and the soap were refreshing, and of course the in-dining was superb.

Strategic,"hotel is very strategically located to the nearest mall ( raffles mall), chijmes, and from there we can also walk to national gallery and other nice little shops.  Bed were a bit small , ordered a twin room but got a king instead ( twin size bed were just 1 meter width ) >> compared to other hotels with a 1.20 meter bed. it felt a bit tight. Swimming pool were pretty small considering that it is used for both (new and older ) building.  Coffee shop is always busy, and the cafe at the hotel lobby serves great desserts and drinks. Overall its ok, will stay there again.",40,Jun-17,Travelled with family,44,6,Carlton
Very nice hotel,"The Carlton Hotel was very nicely appointed and within walking distance of most attractions. When I say walking distance, I mean 20 to 30 minutes walk to places like Gardens by the Bay or China Town. Raffles is right next door.   The gym was quite large and well appointed for a hotel and the swimming pool was nice, but probably a bit small given the size of the hotel.   Alcoholic drinks were very expensive, but that's pervasive throughout Singapore. Think $12 for a beer.   Be warned - the hotel takes $100 from you account pre check in and this is not returned to your account for two weeks after check out. ",40,Jun-17,Travelled as a couple,53,19,Carlton
Disappointing staycation,"Disappointing staycation. Made reservations with family of four for 2 bedrooms. Our request is for a high floor. We got a low floor and our 2 bedrooms were facing the lift lobby. We could hear noisy hotel guests coming back at 12 midnight so we didn't sleep well. The air-con made a strange sound in both our bedrooms (when the AC's fan is left at low or medium level). We could hear the fan motor switched on and off on short intervals so again, we didn't sleep well. Mattress feels old, there is an indent in the middle. If management wish to find out more, please contact me.",20,Jul-17,Travelled with family,73,46,Carlton
As expected.,It is difficult for me to rate this hotel as they did nothing exceptional but did exactly what you expect from a hotel in this price class. Check in was smooth. Breakfast buffet was good and room was clean. Had some issues with the IPTV but that was fixed within 10 minutes. Hotel across the road from Raffles City thus within walking distance to the MRT station. Great location for shopping and sightseeing. Overall a great experience and I will return here in the future.,50,Jun-17,Travelled with family,56,60,Carlton
Lovely hotel but.... ,"I quite often stay at this hotel up to 8 times a year for the past three or so years and bring my colleagues with me (1-4 people at a time) staying from one night and up to one week per visit  but I have noticed every time I stay at the hotel my colleagues get upgraded to the club lounge while I never do get upgrade. I am a regular and book a premier room yet I never get upgraded. I asked why and apparently because I book via my company and via our Amex booking service, even though I pay on my own credit card. However the Carlton don't recognise or upgrade unless I book direct. So I question loyalty and I wonder why should I be loyal to this hotel or book colleagues in or even suggest they book at hotel. It is central, great rooms and people lovely but that's it..... no loyalty…",30,Jul-17,Travelled on business,115,138,Carlton
Excelllent again,"We arrived at the hotel around 8.00am after our flight from London and were feeling pretty well worn out. Reception said they would ready our room by 10.00am and would we like to avail ourselves of the Premier Lounge facilities while we waited, which we did.Sure enough at 10.00am our Premier Club Room was ready and we settled in for another very nice 3 night stay. The only negative on this visit was the lukewarm breakfast in the Premier Club Lounge on the last day, maybe the heaters didn't go on early enough. Anyway we will return!",50,Jun-17,Travelled as a couple,98,48,Carlton

Fantastic location - unbeatable. ,"Had a 5 night stay at the Carlton - the location is the best I've had in Singapore. Very close to City Hall MRT which is 2 stops from the Orchard Road. Also a very quick journey to Marina Bay and it's over the road from Raffles!   The hotel itself is okay. We were 'upgraded' to a premier room which I would decline in the future. This is because the basic rooms (which I booked in to) have been renovated, however the premier rooms have not and are older. Therefore if I were to stay again I would decline the upgrade. That said, the premier room was nice as it had a bath tub to relax in after a long day.  The front desk and housekeeping were very good - exchanging foreign currency and making up the room late in the day  Overall I'd definitely recommend the Carlton and would…",40,Jun-17,Travelled as a couple,54,43,Carlton

Poor clients´ service,"I have not yet been to the hotel but am already very dissapointed with the service received by the Reservations Officers with regards to an ""8 month"" advance reservation which should be breakfast inclusive according to their website.

FORGET THE CLUB LOUNGE,"The club lounge for our 17th level room was on the 4th level with covered windows and cold air-con. Food was of a dubious quality ... hot evening pastries recycled cold on the breakfast bar, dry bread for toasting, stale croissants. For an evening drink, only one style of red and white wine was offered.  It was not an inviting lounge  and not worth paying extra when there are so many other options in the near vicinity.  Also found it irritating to return to our room as late as 3.00 pm, to find it not made up.  Otherwise, the hotel is well located with the Raffles Hotel, Raffles shopping complex, and MRT directly opposite, the HOHO is a short walk, and Chijmes across the street has so many terrific restaurants.",30,Jun-17,Travelled as a couple,48,22,Carlton

Best location in Singapore. ,"If you are sight seeing in Singapore then this is your hotel! Literally walking to distance to all the main attractions Singapore has to offer: Bugis, Little Arab Town, Orchard Ave, Clarke Quay, Raffles etc. City Hall station is only a few mins walk away too. Perfect!  The rooms were nice, quite corporate and clinical but clean and sufficient nonetheless. Only thing I wish the rooms had was a bath. I rarely take one but all the walking from sight seeing had me craving a hot bath!  Shower has a lot of power to it, seems like a random thing to notice but when you come form a 5* hotel which dribbles out water in the shower.. A bit of extra water pressure is appreciated.  Don't bother going to Tuxedo Cafe downstairs for a coffee.. At $9 a pop it ain't worth it! ",50,Jun-17,Travelled as a couple,33,64,Carlton

There was a taxi rank outside the hotel which was reasonably priced, which we used to take us to the night safari.

Wedding lunch,"Went to a wedding lunch at Carlton Hotel located at Bras Brasah. The service is fantastic but the food quality is average only.   Carpark is quite narrow so if you drive there, you might want to be more careful going down the carpark ramp.

It has a nice view and ample seating room, their food selection could be improved though.

Every time I had to call for serviceman to tune the room temperature cooler or warmer. The ceiling light next to the window cannot turn on again after I turned off every time. As informed by the technician, there is something wrong with the contact equipment and he cannot complete the repair in a short time. I wonder why they give such a room to customer to stay.

Worst customer service I've ever received...,"The hotel lobby is pristine enough, and the room seemed freshly renovated--clean and organized. HOWEVER, their customer service is completely unacceptable. We realized on the first night we checked in we should have stayed anywhere but the Carlton.    One of the reasons why we stayed at the Carlton was that it offers free smart phones for guests, a feature that is prominently featured on the hotel website. We realized that the phone was missing from the room, so we called down to front desk to ask. No one picked up after 3 tries! After multiple attempts still no answer from the concierge or reception (which was a theme throughout our stay), I went down to speak directly with staff, who initially seemed surprised by the fact that there was no phone.

My room was on the 23rd floor and the views were just amazing. The bed was comfortable and there was everything you could need in the room. After check out I had a few hours to kill and was suggested to sit by the pool for a drink which was a great way to unwind.

The facilities in the room are good, a comfortable firm bed, good pillows, good sized towels and a fantastic rain shower and bath.  My main disappointment was the club lounge.  The layout doesn't lend to meeting fellow travellers, they do not provide bourbon in the bar and you cant take drinks or fruit back to your room.

Nice and comfy,"This hotel was perfect for our stop over in Singapore. It was a $25 taxi from the airport including luggage, and very convenient to the train station at Raffles and walkable to Bugis shopping centre during the day.  Staff were friendly and professional. The room was well equipped with its own smart phone that was free to use during our stay - helping us to navigate through the city without the need to buy a local sim card.  All the amenities were great. The only thing to mention is that the twin room has an ""open plan"" bathroom so if you're not travelling with family it can be slightly awarkward to come out of the shower cubicle to grab your towel and change discretely as there is no bathroom door in the room.  All up though, I would come back to stay again.",50,Apr-17,Travelled with friends,10,0,Carlton

No care for the fact the girls have nowehere to stay and have just had a long flight. No care for making them wait for over an hour at the reception desk. Completely humiliating them!

Great rain shower! USB sockets are really handy, kettle also.  Air Con was not very effective and I had to ask for a fan which was provided with no problem.  The $40 per night charge for use of exec lounge is worth it for the 2 pieces of laundry included each day as I was at the end of a long trip.

Weekend trip,"Stayed at Carlton Hotel for a weekend trip for Coldplay concert in Singapore. Chose the hotel based on the great location: it is within walking distance to 2 MRT stations : City Hall & Bras Basah for City Circle line. It is also directly in front of Raffles City Shopping Mall, which makes food options & shopping easy - if you don't have time to go to Orchad Road.  The check in process is quick & efficient, the concierge is helpful & kind, helping us with booking a taxi, the direction etc.  The room itself looks quite new with quite a spacious bathroom. All in all it is an excellent value for a great hotel, it's missing a point for a very simple tea & coffee pack in the room  and hot water takes a while to heat. However I will gladly return.",40,Apr-17,Travelled with friends,10,0,Carlton

Great place to stay in heart of Singapore,"We stayed a night at the Carlton Hotel as part of a recent 6 night visit to Singapore.  We were upgraded to a suite (#1401) which gave stunning views over the city at night.  It's location is great, close to Bras Basah MRT, with a nice pool.  Breakfast buffet was great, although coffee could do with some improvement :)  Only gripe was that our air conditioning kept clicking all night, switching on and off all night.  Was very distracting!  Other gripe was inconsiderate guests staying in adjoining rooms who banged their doors for about 15 mins around midnight as they ran across the hall from one room to the other.  Overall, I would recommend the Carlton.",40,Mar-17,Travelled as a couple,129,47,Carlton

On check in, we were instantly upgraded to a suite room, what a gokd way to start our holiday. When we entered, the room is spacious and spotless, the bed is wonderful. The breakfast was really good with so much to choose from and the staffs are really professional. The service is quick and i could not really find any fault from the services that we had until our check-out. From all the hotels that i've stayed in in Singapore, this is my favorite and I will definitely be coming back.",50,Feb-17,Travelled with friends,2,2,Carlton

Taxies are easy to get in front of hotel but also a walking distance to many shoppings, mrt-station etc. Lots of nice restaurants very near and legendary Raffels hotel and its giftshop is a neighbour :) Friendly staff but booking more nights couldn't be done cause they adwised us to go booking.com which was a bit aquard.

Your next best in City Hall,"This hotel is definitely worth your consideration as it is just a 3' min walk to Raffles City shopping mall and you don't pay the price of that in Fairmont or Swissotel which are both connected to the mall. And honestly you don't need that at all. For a decent sleep, close to the city, stones throw away from the mall and Mrt , I will definitely pick Carlton the next time im back in Singapore. Cafe mosaics breakfast however isn't as grand as that of fairmont' but who cares as my tummy prefers the local delights in Singapore!  Definitely consider Carlton for your next trip to Singapore!

Family Visit to Singapore,One of those hidden gems in Singapore if I may say. The price reasonable for a night and a very strategic place. Its near the Raffle City Mall and connected to the Green MRT City Hall so going to Orchard or Airport is relatively easy.   The concierge was very2 helpful. Check in was a breeze.

Unprofessional Staffs.,"I was checked in by a trainee. She execute the checked in very well. I was upgrade to premier suite. Upon check  in the room i realised the air con controller on the wall isnt working and the room wasnt cold so I decided to call the housekeeping for asst. 2 malay engineering came. Both were were relatively rude and the words they used wasnt polite. They seems to claim the room was cold and sounded sarcastic. The words they use among themselves such ""Sial"" which means jinx infront of me. I am utterly dissapointed with the service that was rendered by your hotel staffs.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"A fantastic hotel, centrally located, with a great club room on the 19th floor that served great breakfasts.  Our room was well appointed and spacious.  Only issue was we couldn't adjust the air conditioning on the wall control.  We needed to have maintenance adjust it four times and it was still too cold.  Didn't enjoy that too much. The staff in the club room were exceptional, except for one rude girl.  This did not detract from our stay though.

Upgrade to  premier club,This hotel is perfectly located and actually over looks the famous raffles hotel with the entrance to the raffles long bar only 30 seconds away. The hotel is large and we paid for a premier club room which limited access to our floor and also gave access to a dedicated lounge which was on the top floor and gave great views of the city and between 6 and 8 in the evening offered from alcohol and soft drinks as well as canapes but proved to be far more than nibbles.

The bar downstairs has really nice concoctions so if you have the mood for drinking, do try them.

Expect to get ripped off,This hotel takes $100 off your credit card for goodness knows what reason.  21 days after leaving I am still waiting for my card to be credited. 200 roomsx $100.00 over 20 days ?

Worse experience ever....,"Unfortunately our experience at  Carlton Hotel Singapore was horrible.The rooms took over 6 hours to be ready even though they were booked in September 2016, and the only compensation they offered was a free drink that when we went to use the cafe informed us was not valid. The hotel housekeeping staff totally disregarded that there was a roll-a-way bed in one of  the rooms, so every day we had to ask for linen and water for three people. The roll-a-way was so basic and uncomfortable for my 13 year old son that an airbed would have been better that we took over ourselves. Then on checking out there was a discrepancy with the bill as I had booked through an agent for the roll-a-way, so I was forced to pay for the horrid service again, bad bed again.

Good hotel,"This hotel is very modern and clean and in a great location. Our room was very small and cramped, there wasn't really anywhere to fit all of our luggage, so we were not happy about that. Apparently it was an upgrade to what we had originally booked because there were no more king rooms available in our original grade booking. If this was an upgrade I can only imagine what I our original room was supposed to be like. We didn't eat at the restaurant at this hotel but I heard it's very good.

Excellent hotel with one caveat...,"A friend and I stayed at this Carlton for a long weekend recently.  The location is very good as it is in between two subway stations (City Hall and Bras Basah) as well as easy walking distance to Orchard Road, etc.  The breakfast buffet is phenomenal-definitely include this with your hotel package if possible.  Customer service was spot on as well as housekeeping.  The pool area is very nice.  My only negative would be that there is now no hotel bar.  Apparently they closed down ""Gravitas"" but I don't believe there are plans for another bar.  Keep this in mind if this is important to your hotel stay.  Overall, nice stay at a mid priced hotel.

A great place to stay and will return.,"Great Hotel. Concierge are superb. Nicely appointed rooms and housekeeping are like ninjas - the rooms were always tidied up regardless of when we disappeared! Excellent location and close to Raffles, Raffles City Marketplace, Bugis Junction etc. A couple of things to be wary of though 1. Drinks prices are absurd - I expect to pay a premium but $11 + 3% service charge + 7% GST for a Coke is ridiculous. 2. Expect to leave a deposit of $50 per night as security - not a biggy but could compromise those managing a card budget.

Very high quality hotel,"Stunning hotel, backed up by outstanding service. The construction and interior design of the Fullerton Bay make it a unique place to stay. The marina location is as central as it gets and the view across the water to MBS is a great one. We stayed in a third floor corner room, which was high spec and with views of the water on two sides. The rooftop pool is a special area for spending time in central Singapore. The Lantern bar is a great vantage point for evening drinks and watching the light show. The hotel feels more relaxed and less touristy than MBS (which works at MBS, not a slight on that experience- certainly also worth checking out). We stayed with our twenty two month old daughter for two nights. Service was exceptionally good and welcoming, though perhaps the vibe is better suited to families at Shangri-La. Two nights at the end of our trip were memorable and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Alvin the butler and Indra on reception were particularly helpful, nothing was too much trouble- very welcome when travelling with a toddler and much appreciated. All their colleagues were also very kind. Perhaps best recommended for couples who want a more chilled, but high-end, boutique experience. Five star review an easy decision.…",50,Aug-22,Travelled with family,12,0,Fullerton

Disappointing and not up to standard,Always used to look forward to and enjoy my stays at the Fullerton Bay Hotel.  Despite the perfect location for Singapore the Fullerton team are not providing 5 star service.  Teamwork looks poor across the various teams be that the kitchen and front office service teams are not working together.  Service is slow and disjointed.  Teams are trying but it looks like there is a gap in senior management oversight.  After years of being a massive fan of the Fullerton Bay I will not be staying there again and will not be recommending it to friends and family.

Best trip to Singapore May 2022,"5 stars  all over, location, service, food and accommodations. Unforgettable family trip. Although flights were long and luggage missed the connecting flight and arrived 2 days later, it was worth it. Enjoyed some Michelin star restaurants plus the nightly light shows at the Marina. Changi airport is very clean and efficient. VAT refunds were efficient. There are no priority ques for business class travelers but there was no need. The facial recognition check in was very fast. Security check is prior to boarding the flight so one must allow sufficient time to board. Singapore should be on everyone's bucket list or must visit list. Caters to all ages and tastes.

First, having stayed in manny similar hotels elsewhere in Asia, I was surprised by the narrow options for breakfast (which is usually one key feature of many high end hotels in the region), maybe it is was due to Covid restrictions, but I was quite surprised to see that there were only a few a la carte options, rather than the usual massive spread of different buffet and a la carte alternatives.

Best staycation ,"One of the best hotels we have stayed. Good services, attentive and friendly across all services, front desk, f & b, house keeping... Above all is, Ms. Kelly Shum, due to miscommunication, but Ms. Kelly went all out to make good of everything without us been delay or any discomfort. All the best to her. Meals at Jade and The Landing Point were fantastic. Good foods and services, the best. Older service s gentleman at Jade who served tbl 28 and Ms. Lotha of the Landing Point. Well done. But just a little bit of impatient from a serving staff during breakfast this morning, 10th April. A big thank you for the wonderful stay and services. Especially to Ms. Kelly Shum.

Great Service for food and drinks,We had a wonderful Friday evening out here! A great view of the Marina area with a fun music playlist.  The Service was outstanding - nothing was too much trouble (especially considering we had complicated dietary needs on our table). Thanks to Loges who served us for most of the evening. We felt very well looked after. To top it off the food was very good quality indeed!   We haven't been back to the Fullerton Bay for a few years but we were pleased to see the service and food quality has improved considerably since our last visit! Get some live music going on on Friday and Saturday and this would be the perfect venue!   Book in advance if you want to guarantee a table in a good spot for the view.,50,Apr-22,Travelled with friends,5,0,Fullerton

Long check-in and Hotel categorises guests according to room types,"Poor customer service from the front desk. The manager Kelly Shum clearly categorises the hotel guests according to the room type. Do not waste your money staying in the Fullerton Bay but rather we recommend the Fullerton Hotel which the staffs there are friendlier and more welcoming. Check-in paperwork took at least 20minutes but to only inform that the room would not be ready anytime soon. The manager used condescending tone to inform that the guests that received their keys before us were staying in different room types despite arriving later than us. From the time we reached to check-in at the front desk to collect the keys, it took 50 minutes. ",10,Mar-22,Undisclosed,1,0,Fullerton

Ample of sightseeing attractions around,"Elegant scenic hotel ground, surrounded by plenty of attractions to enjoy around the area.  Carpark and some facilities like sauna are in separate buildings, a short walk away.  Bay view room are pretty standard, aside from the magnificent view. Bed wasn’t the most comfortable though and tv channels slightly limited.   High note really was the daily breakfast, palatable menu selections, served by au fait and attentive crew.   There are so much attractions and activities to explore around the hotel that our 4 days 3 nights stay passed in a blink, we were kept busy throughout the staycation and there’s still plenty to discover.

Worth the hype and price,"Booked a stay at this lovely property for my wife's birthday and we thoroughly enjoyed it. I have been eyeing this hotel for quite some time as I want to experience all the hype around it.      We booked the room  overlooking MBS and what a view it was. Those thinking of staying here should really stay in a room with this view as I feel it really justify the price.      The room was well furnished with things you expect from a 5 star hotel. The only thing I hated was the baby crib they provided, it looked like it wasn't being properly maintained. It was clean but it looked aged. And I had to bend down so low to pick up my baby.

It was the start of school holiday in SINGAPORE. I checked in at about 3.30pm and was told that room was not ready. The person did not acknowledge my birthday or anything special. But it’s ok as long as I get my room. I was told to wait without any updates on the room availability, no offer of drinks or whatsoever.   At about 4.15,  was not ready and was told that it will only be available at earliest 5pm. I was pretty mad because I had a dinner at 6pm with my family.

Pleasant and enjoyable stay,"We stayed two nights at TFBH in Nov 2021.   We arrived earlier than check in time so we had to wait at the lobby for a while, but still the staff helped to arrange such that we could check in slightly earlier, which we appreciated.   The room was relatively spacious. It also had a proper working desk and chair, one seater sofas and access to the balcony — the latter turned out to be super useful as the room was often too cold, so we left the balcony door open once in a while. Bathroom was nice, spacious, and clean. Since we stayed two nights, housekeeping came to tidy up the room on the 2nd day.

Disappointing experience,"Our stay at the Fullerton bay hotel was disappointing. While making a reservation on email, the staff took almost 10 hours to respond. By the time they responded they then informed that they ran out of rooms. After I gave feedback they managed to make a room available for us. At check-in, staff were not welcoming nor friendly. At 3pm they told us the room was still not ready - this is standard check-in time and a well-run five star hotel should not fail this expectation. Upon giving feedback (which was met with unhappiness by the staff receiving it), they reluctantly changed our room and gave us one that was available.

Secondly, the light would not turn on when I had to use the bathroom at 6am. Instead, an eye-searing emergency light flashed for minutes as a technician was trying to fix it.

Honeymoon!!,"Pros  - Food at La Brasserie breakfast was great.  - Concierge team was very welcoming and helpful with our luggages & complimentary parking tickets. - Room was amazing great complimentary tea (TWG) and coffee.  - Room also had a balcony and overlooks the marina bay sands soooo beautiful in the day and at night! - Swimming pool had both public and “private” smaller jacuzzi pools. The private ones were perfect for couples on a honeymoon like me and my husband!  Cons - we came at 3pm for check in and waited for 1.5hrs as room was not available yet.   Overall, fantastic stay!!! Highly recommended!! :)",50,Nov-21,Travelled as a couple,2,0,Fullerton

Lovely hotel for first business trip in many months,"I am over the moon about my stay at the Fullerton Bay.  I had a normal room, but it was large, well lit, and had a peaceful balcony overlooking customs house.  Sitting on the sofa on the balcony made all the difference.  Of course, everything else about the hotel, the service, etc is wonderful.   My only complaint is about the breakfast (boring, small portions, cheap ingredients) and the gym (tiny!  only two treadmills, of which one is blocked off due to covid), one bike and one elliptical.  One pulley weight stack, but falling very short of the five star standard.  I loved that the Fullerton Bay is a small hotel, but this was not good.   By contrast the swimming pool saved the day.  It was wide, 25M, and had an excellent view of Marina Bay Sands . I will come back! ",50,Nov-21,Undisclosed,165,160,Fullerton
Unwind by the bay,"Superb stay for two nights in the theme room. The Fullerton Bay is just a great property in an amazingly scenic location with great views of and access to the bay. Great F&B within the hotel, and loads within a couple of minutes walking distance around it. Our suite package came with sweet complimentaries, like things in the minibar (excepting alcohol) and also free-flow drinks and snacks at the Lantern bar. Service was great with all of our requests from adapter plugs to decanters promptly met. Our corner suite had balconies on two sides with sweeping views all around the bay, so just sitting there with a glass of wine at golden hour made it worthwhile.",50,Nov-21,Travelled with family,41,31,Fullerton

Average stay in Singapore,"We stayed in 4 hotels across 1 week and this was by far the ""worst"" hotel experience. We were surprised as we were very much looking forward to our stay, but the entire experience from start to finish was so impersonal and lacking in service. No answer when we called down to the lobby for help, no turn down service, no help with baggage - definitely not what we'd consider a 5 star standard. If you're after a great view of the Marina bay, you could stay here but frankly, there are other phenomenal hotels in Singapore to stay at.",20,Nov-21,Undisclosed,34,8,Fullerton

Starting from the check-in process, it was smooth and seamless. We were offered an early check-in at 10AM. The special complimentary arrangement that was requested was executed to perfection, with a pair of Fullerton bears and a helium ballon, plus a postcard and a box of macarons. This kind of attention to detail and going above and beyond for the hotel guests is what separate between a great hotel and a good one.

( to name a few of the hotels we stayed before… Andaz, Mandarin oriental, and Raffles, all without failing to note our birthday when we checked in; then they sent us warm birthday wishes and even small cake and birthday card signed by staff …)  Anyway, we got a room facing CBD, no upgrade ( btw last time we stayed in Andaz and Raffles got upgraded even staying one night only)  The room is big in size, a bit aged, with a small tv.  The favourite part of this hotel to me is the swimming pool and the poolside…",40,Oct-21,Travelled as a couple,34,0,Fullerton

Best hotel stay I've ever had in Singapore,"Stayed over with my wife for our anniversary and we had the most wonderous time ever, upon hearing that we were celebrating, they gave us a room upgrade to one facing MBS. This hotel is miles above any other hotel we've ever stayed in. Room service food was ok, but the service is insane, they get every single detail correct. The speed of everything was fast and well time. There was an in room chrome cast where you can play your own music. The bathtub was well equipped with bath salts and the rest of the regular amenities. Water pressure was good at the shower.

My brother and I are writing this on behalf of our parents (we are nine year old twins),"My family went to the Fullerton Bay hotel for my Mom's birthday. It was one of the best hotels we have been to.  Here are a few reasons why:      First,  is that we got free ice cream ( which we loved ) with an ice cream ID/Pass that we could use ever day.  Another reason why we loved this hotel is our room and the hotel's pool was amazing.  Last but not least the hotel people were very welcoming. One example is someone opened the door for us . This was a amazing hotel because firstly we got free ice cream (and a cake for my mom's bday), second of all  we loved the amazing room and the pool, and finally the people are amazing.

Best hotel in Singapore,"I've been to a few 5 stars hotel in Singapore, including Mandarin Oriental, MBS but this is the best one. We got the Bay View Room for 3 nights. It has a balcony; the view is fantastic. The room is spacious. We love the small details that made this better than other hotels such as: very soft bath robes; bath tub with a small pillow for your head; free TWG tea and coffee maker in the room. The swimming pool is pretty and clean. We love the food: The signature burger, the braised beef cheek, the afternoon tea with cakes, the daily breakfast and the dim sum brunch are all delicious and fulfilling.  In general, it's been a wonderful experience. We'll definitely return.",50,Jun-21,Undisclosed,1,0,Fullerton

It was a hard to resist offer.  Took the offer, and stayed two nights with the Premier Bay View Room (I had an upgrade). The view was fantastic. The sounds of lapping water against the hotel was extremely therapeutic. I could sit hours at the balcony and enjoy the view with the constant cool breeze.   The decor is impressive.

Had issues upon check out on the bill and the way he handle the issue made us very disappointed. Even though the email from the hotel clearly indicates that dining credit can be used at TOWN restaurants, the hotel has to investigate if they want to approve it or not.

Second, and more importantly, it has an exclusive, unrivalled location on the bayfront promenade. Other hotels in the area can claim to have a bay view, but only the Fullerton Bay can boast to be right at the bayfront, over the water in fact.   Given this, it is absolutely incumbent that you minimally book a bay view room to fully enjoy the hotel’s unique appeal (yes, the premium over the entry rooms is totally worth it; it will make perfect sense every time you enter the room).

"Amazing food, even amazing service","Had a really good evening at La Brasserie as part of my staycation at the Fullerton Bay Hotel. We had some dining credits so why not use them at La Brasserie. The food was great - my first time having escargots and they were fantastic with nice texture and good pesto sauce! We had the seafood Royale and the ingredients were fresh. For our main, we shared the côté de boeuf which was more than what we imagined. But beef was amazing with tender texture and nice amount of fat to make you feel really satisfied in your palette.   What made the experience great was the amazing service and interactions we had with Kumar and Lotha who were of great help in recommending food portions, and making the evening a memorable one.

However: -Check in was very slow, even though we had completed all of the paperwork prior to arrival. We were given complimentary drinks for the delays which was a nice offer, but the problem was simply not enough staff on the reception area. -We had a room with a balcony and a fantastic view across the Marina, however we there was only one chair on the balcony.

The Fullerton Bay Hotel staycation,"Overall, a frendly and clean environment stay on 02 April, I would rate  7/10.

Fullerton Hotel Landing Point Hi-Tea A disappointment!,"Due to Covid-19 situation, the hi-tea at Landing Point is a disappointment. We paid $52+++ person for hi-tea from 3- 5.30pm. 1st round was 2 Trays of pastries and small nit bits as shown in my pictures. The food selection was so limited too. We waited so long for 2nd & 3rd round of top up for the food and coffee/tea as there is short of staff. But the hotel hi-tea was fully booked. I'm sure the hotel is aware that it is full booking for the hi-tea yet they are under- staff. We are unable to eat more as we waited so long for the top up. The drinks wait was long too.   Nonetheless, the staff is aware that we are unhappy and they apologise. They offer us 20% for Citibank Premier Miles card.

Terrible experience,"We booked the Fullerton bay hotel for our honeymoon staycation but was sorely disappointed by the experience.   The hotel room rate is on the premium end among hotel rates in Singapore and yet the TV near the bathtub area was not working and there were also no local channels available to watch for the main TV in the room. The main tv quality was also very grainy, making it very difficult to watch the other limited channels available. This meant that we basically couldn't even enjoy watching tv in a premium hotel room.   The buffet breakfast experience was also very poor.

Pleasurable experience at the La Brasserie,"Excellent service by Kumar and Vijay. Love the ambiance and food.  The breads served along with the rillette was fantastic, the escargots with garlic bread was good but I would definitely  recommend the prawns with chorizo.  Soups were great but could have much more depth of flavour to the mushrooms. The onion soup was spot on and I enjoyed it  I had the beef cheek for my main course and I would prefer to have it served with sauce, nonetheless the meat was perfectly done. The lamb tasted wonderful with such succulent meat with aromatic herbs.  Dessert was satisfying, simple but never compromising on flavour  the apple desser with yuzu sorbet brightened my heavy meal after the mains.

Excellent Fine Dining and Service,"We had a delightful time dining at La Brasserie for my birthday!

Our food was delicious from start to finish, emphasising traditional French dishes - such as escargot, onion soup and Confit de Canard, which we couldn’t get enough of. If you are as much a soup addict as I am, I highly recommend trying both the traditional onion and the champignon and truffle.

"Pleasant stay, amazing service but not worth the price.","What really made my experience at Fullerton Bay was the service. Staff were extremely attentive, accommodating, helpful and polite. My favourite parts of the hotel were definitely the pool and Lantern - amazing views to enjoy a cocktail and bar bites in the evening.  We were also there for our honeymoon and had mentioned it to the hotel. We were greeted with a very sad, deflated looking balloon and a bear with a handwritten note. It was extremely underwhelming especially for the luxurious branding of the esteemed ""Fullerton Bay Hotel"". We were not expecting much, but based on our experience with other hotels during birthdays / anniversaries in which we received complimentary cake / alcohol / room upgrades, Fullerton Bay fell extremely short. That was quite disappointing for us. …",30,Nov-20,Undisclosed,81,41,Fullerton

I understand the need to ensure a high level of cleanliness and hygiene during this period, but with check out timings at 11am, I can’t understand why it took so long for the room to be prepped.

Every time we walked past concierge, he would also make it a point to chat with us and ask about our well-being.

Place is nicely furnished with sofa settees and feels comfortable, however food was a letdown. We were served tea or coffee of our choice and you can change later on if you decide to have another beverage. Food was served on a 3 tier carrier, very nicely arranged, and just enough for 2 pax. The food is refillable and will be served to you. Kueh pie tee shell was dry n hard, ingredients inside were made very dry so as not to make the shell soggy. Pastry with beef rendang was also made very dry for the same reasons. Chicken sandwiches were just so so. The only thing that I liked were the lemon tarts.

Birthday staycation,Informed FBH beforehand that the staycation was meant for birthday celebration and truly appreciate that they prepared a complimentary slice of cake and birthday balloon for this.

Couldn't find bath salt in the bathroom. Went to the swimming pool by reservation but don't think they maintained an in & out record as we can just go in the pool area without giving our room number. Seems like anyone can just enter without making reservation. All the pool-chairs were taken when we reached. Time limit for each group is supposed to be 90 mins and we fully utilised it.

Interesting decor, I'd call it funky industrial. The rooms (numbers 11 and up on each floor) are unusually long and skinny, maybe 8 metres long and 2 metres wide but after an initial WTF you find it works quite well. Avoid rooms 01, a very small and cramped double, and rooms 02 an even smaller and more cramped single. Everything is very clean, the shower is hot, the bed is good.

Reception staff Ms Nana offered us a room fitted w senior friendly amenities - seat in shower area, grab bars in the toilet, low bed for easie movement, spacious room to accommodate wheelchair. Ms Natalie was so kind to fulfil our requests to get meals to their room on time and even get vegetarian meals for 1 of them who’s vegetarian. Mr Matthew was ever so friendly greeting us w smiles behind his mask each time we approached the counter. The housekeeping staff were excellent very prompt in cleaning up the room.

stayed 10 nights having everyday same breakfast.,"room is very basic. for long stay the cleaner doesnot clean the room properly. glass, mugs and floors are dirty even after room service. the complementary stuffs in the room were not top up regularly. for short stay or one night stay probably good option. Breakfast has no varities having everyday same menu. location wise good as it is close to bugis and bencoolen MRT.",30,Jul-22,Undisclosed,27,34,HotelG
Three Night Couples Stay,"This hotel is perfect if you want to explore the city for most of the day and you are not spending much time in your accomodation. It is clean & modern. There is a very nice bar with reasonable wine prices at the ground floor and it also has a burger restaurant which also seemed reasonably priced. Bencoolen MRT Station is a short walk and connects with all the main MRT stations including Bayfront. The breakfast was buffet style and was perfect every morning.  Only faults were the size of the room, which made it very difficult to even open a big suitcase and also the lifts are very slow.  Overall ideal for city explorers looking for somewhere to rest their heads at night. ",40,Jul-22,Travelled as a couple,3,4,HotelG

The service is very average, beds are ok but the room is very very small. 2.5 meters by 2.5 meters in the sleeping area.

Honeymoon trip,"We booked 3 nights at Hotel G (a 4 star hotel) room type queen bed when we were back in Cairo but when we arrived and the receptionist ( her name is Hema) knew that we were on our honeymoon trip, she upgraded our room type to king bedroom. She was amazing and super friendly, helped us with a lot of attractions booking. Hotel is at a central location next to a lot of 24/7 open restaurants and supermarkets so we had an amazing experience trying out lots of cuisines (turkish, thai, indian, vietnamese, chinese) and there is like a bar (couple of bars) corner which is open till late (3 am).

There's no wardrobe in this room though so you'll have to hang your clothes by the mirror at the entrance where there's only 4 hangers.  Food: Only comment for the burger combo we had that was included in our promo package was that the fries tasted a little stale. Otherwise, the burgers themselves were pretty decent!

Fantastic location,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights from the 15th June, the hotel is in a good location with loads of shops, restaurants and markets nearby. We ate in both restaurants located under the hotel as if you are a guest you can have a discount, food really good in both. Our room was spotless we were on the 6th floor in 0632, the room itself is very small but we knew that before we arrived so wasnt much of a shock, we did joke that the pictures made the room look huge, all basics in the room and really comfy bed with quilted mattress protector which always makes a difference, they have a green policy so wont clean the room the day after you arrive unless you request it which i think is quite a good idea, overall really good experience and would definately stay here again",50,Jun-22,Travelled as a couple,1,0,HotelG

Dysfunctional establishment geared to facilitate the management not the customer!,This is a dysfunctional  establishment which appears to be run to facilitate the the management  not the customer! Different facilities like Ginett and 25° are open at different times on different days. You also have to book well in advance for Ginett (during my 6 night stay I was unable to secure a table in the restaurant). The various parts of the ‘hotel’ are dysfunctional with each other as I was unable to book the restaurant at reception for Tuesday when Ginett was closed on a Monday! I have numerous other examples but since I suspect the management would not be interested I will not waste my time,20,Jun-22,Travelled solo,1,0,HotelG

You are only choose one main course, which is the most terrible and worth to choose to stay at others hotel including buffet breakfast. The hotel management should public explicitly about this option for guest to consider to book at this hotel rather than mention ”Breakfast Included” - Service is just ok.

You have to get an appointment from the receptionist and he (Mr. Luke) insisted it is not open before 6am. No room for negotiation. Basta.   For a 4 Star hotel one would expect a bottle of water in the room, or a shaving set, or maybe both. But neither is available.

"2nd staycay, and will still be back","This review came really late relative to our second staycay here, but I couldn't live with myself if I didn't come to sing praises for this hotel, and more importantly, its staff. It's going to be a long read, so I apologize in advance.  Our (my fiancé and I) first time staying in Hotel G was last year when we decided to use my SRV vouchers to book a staycay during the pandemic. We stumbled upon Hotel G because the partner was looking for a boutique hotel, and personally I wasn't expecting too much because my impression of boutique hotels was that they were usually quite slip-shod or badly-maintained.  After our first stay, however, I really had to eat my words back because I was so impressed! Our room was small (would be lying if I said it wasn't), but it was so cozy and just…",50,Feb-22,Undisclosed,1,0,HotelG
"Fast Check-in, Reasonable Price and Clean","I was served by Bella from the Front Desk. She checked me in less than 5 minutes. Amazing! I remembered her from my last visit here last month. She never fails to serve with a smile while quickly sorting out the booking.  I would recommend the hotel because of the reasonable price point for quick staycations, cleanliness of the room, and the comfy bed. This is probably my 5th time here, and counting. I’d recommend booking in earlier to get better prices.  I’ve dined at both Ginett Restaurant and 25 Degrees restaurants. Love the ambience!",50,Mar-22,Travelled solo,2,0,HotelG

Good for a short stay,"Check in took an hour, due to the fact that the hotel has a very good promotion and it was during the period where very little hotels are open for staycation.  Booked Good Room that comes with $50 dining credit at Ginett and breakfast.  Room is ok, matches with what I paid for. The room does feel a little small, but it should be good enough for 2 normal sized adults.  In room channels are decent.  Breakfast area is crowded, hotel gave the option to take away back to the room.  Overall, good for a 1 night stay.",40,Oct-20,Undisclosed,74,33,HotelG
Hotel G end of july staycation,"Checking in was smooth, room door was already open so i assume the room just did the housekeeping and no one was inside.

Burgers from 25 Degrees (package) were so good, they weren't scrimping with the patty sizes. Preferred the Number One over the Number Two. Dined at Ginett and used the F&B dining voucher. Olio Scampi was a tad bland, but the prawns were juicy. Wine vouchers (from spotting difference in lift doors) were used, and was great too.

You can spend your cash on good food.   2. The rooms are small but the service is great.  The rooms are small, about 15-17 sqm, but I don't feel suffocated. The same can't be said for bigger rooms I stayed in other hotels in SG and overseas. The rooms are nicely and uniquely designed, unlike many business hotels with generic rooms. The mattress they use is serta, so it's very nice to sleep on. Though the pillow can be a tad tough and flat. Also, the air con's temperature and wind speed are adjustable, hooray!

On the day of check in, check in was effortless and no complimentary check out was offered.  Went to 8 storey and check in single room.

The plusses were that the front staff were courteous and professional during check in, the hotel itself was quiet with strong wifi for working, and the breakfast was very filling and delicious. However, not all the perks listed on the package were given, such as the morning and midday snacks. The fresh juices were nice, though.

Affordable stay at an artsy place,"Second time staying here, always very intrigued by the giant dream catcher in the room. However, the dream catcher in my room this time was a bit uglier and plainer than the first (the first had feathers).   Room wise, it’s an affordable stay hence room size is small. It’s still manageable even though the bed is fitted tightly at the corner which means one of the guests would have a hard time going to the toilet in the middle of the night.  Service wise, we had a warm welcome by manager Darryl, a much kinder greeting than our first stay. He allowed us early check in, likely since it was a Friday so there might have more available rooms.

"Cosy, compact Hotel","The room is so compact, it's a tight squeeze for 2 adults. You have to literally climb onto the bed to plonk yourself into the other side. The wash basin is just outside the shower and toilet. There's no wardrobe, just an open hanger with 4 hangers to hang your clothes. A kettle with complimentary coffee/tea bags on a tiny desktop leaves no space to place your personal accessories like phones, jewellery, etc.  Breakfast is the standard western fare or chicken congee, with a cup of cut fruits and croissants. Service is efficient, though you have to ask for butter if you want it with your croissants.  Hotel G is a conveniently located near to MRT stations Rochor/Bencoolen. It's just opposite Fortune Centre and Sunshine Plaza, so food options are aplenty.   ",30,Jan-21,Travelled as a couple,1,2,HotelG

Could be better,"I booked a staycation at Hotel G for my birthday. We were given a time(15:00-15:55hrs) to check-in due to covid-19 measures. We arrived around 15:20hrs and was shocked to see 8 groups of guests before us. All of us were crowding at Lvl 1 lobby. (Plus point: they provided drinks while we wait) After some time of waiting, we were told that we can go up to Lvl 2 to check-in, however when we arrived at Lvl 2 there was still a queue. So we waited patiently again. When it was our turn to check-in, the front desk informed us that the “Get The Party Started package” décor & props are not in the room yet so they ask if they could send it to our room instead which we said yes because at this point we have already waited for 50mins and we do not want to wait any longer.

Great stay for our Anniversary!,Stayed here early November to celebrate my Anniversary. My boyfriend and i got a complimentary upgrade which i truly appreciate! Service rendered during check in was smooth and fast. Excellent! Staffs were all really friendly! Cleanliness in room is superb. Only bummer was that they TV only allow screen mirroring function for Android. But the variety of channels offered compensated for the downfall. So it was fine. No biggy. Overall we did enjoyed our stay and really wish to return soon!   The dream catcher lights in the room is really cool by the way!,50,Nov-20,Undisclosed,45,49,HotelG
Staff is very good.  Excellent dining options.  Rooms are small though.,"Hotel staff is Super professional.  There was quite a lot of people at check in time but still the queue moved fast.

Worth it: Hustle and Grind Package,"This is my second time staying in Hotel G but my first time trying the hustle and grind package for a change of work environment. The package starts from 7am to 7pm. Comfortable and conducive work table. Quiet surroundings. Nice Nespresso coffee machine with four complimentary capsules and drinks in the mini fridge. Perhaps, hotel could have some sort of manual or 'mini notice' on the cute corrugated board on how to use the Nespresso Coffee machine for first timers who have not used the brand of coffee machine. It took me a while to figure it out how to use the Nespresso Coffee machine.   I like that the hotel provided morning and afternoon small snacks in the form of pasteries and snacks during the workation which most hotel workation packages do not provide. That also includes…",50,Nov-20,Undisclosed,139,63,HotelG
Hustle and Grind,"Tried out the Hustle and Grind day use package, really good value for money!  Check in was speedy early in the morning at 8am, Recep was friendly and polite, took time to go through the details for the package.  Room is clean and looks well maintained. One negative is only 1 power socket at the desk, so maybe bring along a power strip if you're have multiple devices! Had to switch plugs between my laptop charger, mobile charger and the coffee machine. Found that the USB sockets didn't seem to work, but no big deal.  Morning and mid day snacks were great! Pastries and bread were delivered to the room and still warm when they reached. Although probably a tad too much for just 1 person, I felt guilty after finishing all the snacks.  Soft drinks (coke and ginger ale) were available,…",50,Oct-20,Travelled solo,124,111,HotelG
Good staycation choice!,"If u're trying to deal with the lockdown by doing local staycations in interesting areas, this is a very good choice.  The rooms are really small, but clean, comfortable and functional - if you want to laze-in during your stay, pick a proper hotel, but if you just want a base from which to explore Bugis, Little India, etc. this place is great. We took their ""Great G"" package which is very good value - came with a $50 Ginett voucher, a bottle of champagne, and breakfast for 2.  Ginett is super popular, so if you're planning to book a staycation here, you should also book your slot at Ginett in advance.  We tried booking 3 days in advance and it was already full for both lunch and dinner so we ended up using our voucher for a mid-afternoon snack. We were concerned they were giving…",40,Oct-20,Undisclosed,1,2,HotelG

Homeless Home for October 2020,"I cannot count the number of stays I did in this hotel before I left Singapore!!! All of you are awesome and thanks for the warmth accommodation.  The room is cozy, most of the time I took the corner room with double window.  The cheese platter in the restaurant is popular but I would say the breakfast at 25 degrees is also a must have.  Their friendly staffs (as in all of them) especially Avagail and Adrick can tell my fave is the waffles and the yogurt.  I also miss Tita Gina, their Manager!

Mini-Stayca,"I actually gave Hotel G 4-stars yesterday but decided to review that today and only gave 3-stars instead . We had a rather fuss-free check in, rooms were well-appointed despite being rather small. We actually enjoyed the hotel very much! Not forgetting to mention, they are so near to all the shopping/foodie paradise also known as Orchard, Bugis and Marina Sq/Suntec City. Together with the staycation promotions Hotel G is offering at the moment, everything seems perfect..   UNTIL TODAY.. we have booked a 3D2N staycation and hence as usual expected our rooms to be made-up after we left it at around 11am.

Staycation,"Upon arrival at the hotel, we mentally prepared ourselves to have a long wait in regards to checking-in as there were many complains abt it. To our surprise, the lobby was pretty much empty and check-in was a breeze. Settled in within 15 minutes upon arrival. Staffs were courteous be it behind the counter or just bumping them around the premises.  Room is true to pics and reasonably sized. There was music upon opening the door and got a shocked but it was just their way of welcoming. Lol.. Basics provided. Masks and a small bottle of sanitiser was provided which was not expected at all. So thumbs up on that. Bed is comfy.

This guy was also the one person who is always smiling politely whenever he greets the guests.   The room is super cosy and homely despite its size. Fridge was well stocked with soft drinks and juices. Happy to see the coffee machine with 4 capsules. And definitely thrilled to see the bed clean and huge.

The only thing disappointing is the waiting time for checking in is ridiculously 40 mins , I check in during 430pm but there is still a long queue.   Upon checking out to get back my deposit, I need to queue together with the checking in customers that is require another 20mins of wait. At that point only 1 counter is open.

A great time out for couples looking for staycation,"Hotel G is an excellent choice when it comes to budget conscious couples looking to get some rest from the hectic work week. While their rooms are priced reasonably, it is their packages that make the deal especially attractive.  Most easy to recommend in #BurgersInBed, which comes with their excellent burgers (like really they were amazing). We had a night with their #GlamYourGram package, which included breakfast along with free parking and $50 voucher at their Ginett restaurant. For those who want to explore cheese and wine, there is the place to be. Though other food are also fantastic! Those celebrating birthdays should definitely call in for a special treat. Also, just call in general as they are always packed even on weekdays.  Now to the room. First impression is…",50,Oct-20,Undisclosed,1,3,HotelG
"Fancy place, yet pretentious staff (02nd Oct 2020 - Sat)","Hotel G's 4 star rating needs many areas of improvement when the staff on deck are not there to provide the genuinity of service, I would rate it a transit hotel at its very best.  We check in late about 8pm the night & was asking for late check out the next day, was told to check with staff the next morning .. Then when we asked next morning, we were given 12.30 noon (30 mins extension wow, A for effort).  When we went for the hotel's breakfast in the morning at 25 degrees, the black coffee was not served with condiments (sugar, milk, stirrer).

Even rather peaceful and relaxing music to sleep to 🤣   So room was beautiful, very aesthetic, background music which contributes to the entire experience, a dream home to me, wish I could stay much longer... definitely would come back when given the opportunity.

Used to love but not for this time,"I use to visit hotel G very often and liked it very much. However this time it has been very disappointing.  1) Room we have booked is Great King room. Naturally anyone would expect it to be a king size bed. However I discovered it was actually merged by 2 single beds and there is a gap in between which makes the sleep very uncomfortable. Mattress was also harder and less comfy compared the the queen room bed I used to book  2) The room was quite clean as usual however what I noticed was the remote control. It was very dusty and greasy with dirt stuck in the spaces between the keys. I would have expected that after reopening in phase 2, the hotel would have managed the cleaning and sanitization well. Moreover, the remote control is something which people have their hands on and…",10,Jul-20,Travelled as a couple,1,2,HotelG

To say, the least the moment I walked into the lobby I knew I would be in for a relaxing and enjoyable experience. The ambience was great, the music was jazzy and the overall design was modern and classy. The rooms are no doubt rather small, but what it couldn't make for its size, it made up for it with its cosiness and fully-equipped amenities.

The food in the restaurants is heavy - mostly meat, cheese, and burgers not great and lots of alcohol - bar food. Stylish but if you eat healthy and want a salad you'll have a hard time. there is a veggie burger if you're a vegetarian. Cafes can be found within walking distance.

My 20 yr old loved it as he had his own room.   Rooms are quite small, had to strategically open/store our 2 full size luggages.  The space under the bed isn't big enough to fit our large size luggage. Above all, the bathroom layout is the most inconvenient.

Nitty-gritty issues spoiling our stay,"Have been travelling for 20 hours with 3 kids prior to arriving to the hotel. Maybe i’m too selfish, but just wanted to crush on the bed and have a beer. Well, that will not work. Because MasterCard (embossed) debit cards - which are by the way called ‘world elite’ for whatever reason - will not be accepted by the hotel for deposit, meaning that the minibar will be removed from our room. Not just the contents of the minibar, but the complete fridge. No, you can not chill your own water either. Regardless of paying hundreds of dollars for the two rooms, you are not trusted with the minibar contents, and your room standards are decreased by removing the fridge. Trendy design is not enough for a good hotel, it’s the staff attitude that counts. Shame",20,Jan-20,Undisclosed,1,2,HotelG

This includes the burger place just below the hotel that is open until late night. In terms of room size, don't expect that much. I think it is less than 15sqm. However, despite its size, it looks nice and every part of it is well-thought of. You have a desk that you can work on, which can be a plus if you are traveling for business. Also, the room is clean and the sheets smell fresh. The cleaning staff is also nice and greets people.

Small but good value rooms,The hotel is in a great central location and close to MRT stations. The staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms are very well equipped and the sound proofing is good. I got a good night’s sleep. The breakfast was extensive. Very good selection. The only negatives were the lack of a light switch near to the bed - it was hard to find the light switch in the middle of the night - and the rooms are very small. It was almost claustrophobic for one person. I would not have wanted to inhabit it with two people in the room. You would be bumping into each other and one person would have to climb over the other to get out of bed.,30,Dec-19,Travelled on business,14,22,HotelG

The cost of the rooms is expensive for the room size offered. Also, early check in is S$120 which is insanely expensive and non-negotiable considering our Room Cost per day was S$140. Check in time is 14:00 hrs but the hotel may accommodate you by 13:00 hrs. There are 3 MRT stations at walking distance to the hotel.

Saying that on the last day they were restocking at 10.00am, so perhaps someone had complained. Rooms are tiny and I mean tiny with little natual light. It does however represent value for money. The G bar at night is cool with a nice ""Ibiza"" style vibe to the music.  The difference between G and Marina Bay Sands isn't that much, but they are worlds apart.

Pretentious and not 4 stars,"The rooms are small and that's actually not an issue for me. However, it's trying to hard to be like one of those small boutique places in NYC. Cheap toilets and showers. The quality or breakfast is somewhere between IKEA and travelodge. Breakfast is spread out on different levels and often have to go back and forth. When asked about plates on one floor she grumpily got them but said ""they are on the other floor y'know"". Why not have plates at all the stations...? It's a 4 star hotel y'know... Location cool, but not a place to use if you want more than a bed and def not worth it if more than 1 person in a room. Not worth the price... ",20,Nov-19,Travelled on business,175,145,HotelG

The bar / restaurant on 1st floor was great - decent food, big wine list, and good night scene.   For our taste, traveling with a good bit of luggage, the room was small & cramped.

Lobby is small and can get crowded. First impression of hotel due to lobby area is not good. Staff I would rate as average.  Location is convenient and a short walk from most nearby attractions and shops.

"Small, clean, and good location",Stayed in early November. Our room was on 7th floor and was very small but practical. The hotel is situated less than a quarter mile from the nearest MRT. Below the hotel and is a burger joint which is bustling at night. The same burger joint also serves as the breakfast buffet. Breakfast was decent with a combination of western and local offerings.  One minor gripe with room is that the sink sits outside the bath/toilet and located in the entry way. This felt a bit odd. The ventilation for the bathroom was impressive as there was no visible/audible fan.,50,Oct-19,Undisclosed,65,66,HotelG
Decent hotel with a very good location,"We booked to stay at the Hotel G for 2 nights in Singapore during a brief stopover and chose the hotel primarily because of its location in the city centre, only a 15-20 min walk away from the Raffles City mall and also within 15 mins walk of Bencoolen MRT so quite ideally placed for travelling around the city easily.  Like a lot of trendy, hipster-ish hotels, this is in a converted office building, with a very small lobby. When we entered this lobby to check in, we found it rather unpleasantly crowded with people queuing up at the desks with few empty seats left for people waiting.  Checking in was simple enough but they did not allow us to check in before 2pm unless we upgraded our room - an additional SGD70 for 2 nights so we didn't quibble.

Cute little stay but with some concerns ,"1. I don’t mind small hotels but this hotel “lobby” is so small that it actually causes problems, like long line up with no space to really stand or put baggage.   2. Since the lobby is so small, the lineup to check out actually ended right in front of the elevator when we checkout, which I thought was not quite safe because the way out is blocked and not so convenient.   3. We didn’t have problem with the the tiny room as we imagined when viewing the photos on booking sites. We only had a couple of small baggage so we’re okay.   4. The queen double bed was quite comfortable. But just a note to remind: not easy for the one who sleeps on the inner side the bed. Basically had to walk on the bed thru another person.   5.

Was thinking of a capsule hotel and thought to get a bit bigger than a capsule. The hotel theme is nice but the rooms are cramped. No place to open and put the suitcase. No outlets bedside. Bathroom has no divider between shower and flush.   I'd rather spend a few extra dollars and get a proper room. Trying to imitate the Yotel room style with a hipster feel but did not succeed.   When complained got the answer that all rooms that are available are same size and nothing much different.   Not worth my $126 or credit card points as well  ,30,Sep-19,Travelled solo,1,2,HotelG

Asian style boutique hotel in a nice location,We stayed here for 6 nights during the Singapore Grand Prix.  It’s pleasant and clean hotel with two very nice restaurants.  Ginette was our favorite.  It has a great wine selection and limited but well crafted menu.  The rooms are small by western standards with pod style bathrooms.   The great room king was a bit cramped or cozy for two.  Crawling over your partner to get out of bed is good or bad thing depending on your perspective. We are returning to Singapore in a couple of weeks after visiting Thailand and have booked a western hotel for our second stay.,40,Aug-19,Travelled with family,282,154,HotelG
Just right ,"Service at this hotel is really good, the rooms are small, but well laid out, clean and modern. Water pressure fluctuated, this may have been because we were on the top floor. The only minus point is their breakfast, it wasn't great, scrambled eggs were quite undercooked and cheese available, was processed cheese, however, there are lots of pastries and cereal if you like these for breakfast. The restaurant/bar seemed to be very popular each evening. Overall i would recommend this hotel if you're on a budget visiting Singapore.",40,Sep-19,Travelled as a couple,77,39,HotelG

There is no way for two people to have both of their bags out or clothes out at the same time. My husband and I also stayed at the Rendezvous Hotel and really wish we had stayed there instead due to the room size and closer location to the mrt.

There are lovely and clever design touches throughout that make it more than acceptable for a few nights. The restaurants on the 1st floor offer a good selection if you don’t want to venture too far, however the location is excellent and close to the MRT as well as many attractions.

Not my favourite hotel in Singapore for the price but okay - 3.5/5 is my rating,"This hotel was on my shortlist with another hotel for my first trip to Singapore and I chose the latter because it was ranked slightly higher on TripAdvisor. For my second trip, Hotel G was slightly cheaper than the previous hotel, so I thought I'd give Hotel G a go.   Upon arrival, I didn't appreciate discovering that the airport shuttle bus could not drop me off at reception because the Hotel G car park is of low height. So, I was dropped off in the alley behind the hotel and, after a set of doors meant only for staff, had to find my way up the stairwell and determine which door to open in order to make it inside the hotel.

Every staff member I interacted with was friendly, except perhaps during the hectic breakfast service.  The rooms have been very well designed. They are not big, but a lot of thought has gone into making them efficient. For example, the safety box and luggage space is under the bed. A sliding door is used between the room and the bathroom, which takes up less space. Cleanliness is good. I found it a cosy and comfortable room to stay in. There is a large dreamcatcher hanging above the bed which gives character to the room. The breakfast could be improved.

Cozy Room,My room was the perfect size. My bed was very comfortable. I liked the style of my room. Good shower pressure. Good air conditioner. Short distance to the metro and restaurants. Strong wifi. Tasty breakfast. ,50,Jul-19,Travelled solo,2,6,HotelG
Average,"Htl is nice but my room is to small, my breakfast experience the food isnt tasty, maybe not enough salt n paper or other ingredients, credit point for this htl is near to public transport ( Bus& MRT) and 24 hrs street food ' Al Jaelani' located just one step frm the htl, just incase if u r hungry at midnight,  room is to small n breakfast food frm the htl not to good",30,Jul-19,Travelled with family,1,2,HotelG
Highly recommend this place,"The room isn't as spacious as you will be expecting but the creativity, the warmth and the comfort of the room makes out for it.

It is located nearby some malls, mamak and the bar below the hotel",50,Jun-19,Travelled on business,5,2,HotelG
Great hotel for a little vacation,"My partner and I had a great stay at the hotel. The hotel is in a walking-distance from MRT. The staff were nice and helpful. The lobby was a little crowded when we were checking-in around 2 pm. The room was cozy and provided with essential amenities and there are also water and ice machines near the elevators.  The breakfast was okay for me but if you are looking for different things to eat, there are restaurants at the hotel and across the street.  As it was our anniversary trip, I asked the hotel in advance for a surprise card for my partner but they also gave us the free dessert. Thank you! ❤️",50,Jul-19,Travelled as a couple,186,103,HotelG
Chic hotel with a great location,"The hotel is contemporary. Rooms are small but workable. Location is great. Breakfast selection leaves a bit to be desired, but is appropriate for a 4* hotel.  I think they were short of towels when we visited, as they didn't put new towels after getting the used ones. This happened for the two rooms in our group. I don't particular like shower curtains (which are the ones used in this hotel), and would have preferred a door enclosed shower - but that's a personal preference.",40,Apr-19,Travelled with family,1,2,HotelG
Soundproofing is really bad becoz no carpet floor,"All services are good, but I could hear the upstairs costumer dropping things sagging chair rolling stuff on floor all the time from morning to mid nite .. they really should change the hard floor to carpet flooor!!!",40,Jul-19,Travelled on business,22,23,HotelG
Close to Bugis ,I liked the location and enjoyed the stay. The rooms were compact yet classy. Good for a single person. Breakfast was good. The best thing was the happening bar during evening hours.

Great Hotel,"Great hotel with good location. Overall it was good experience.

Vacation,My wife and I decided to go to Singapore. While we were booking the hotel we noticed everything was very expensive and the rooms were quite small. For a pretty small room this place was very nice. Lots of storage for our luggage and the staff was amazing. Good location right in the middle of it all. Everything is more spread out than I thought but this place is by the tekka and hawka centers so that was nice. ,40,Jul-19,Travelled as a couple,132,86,HotelG
"Nice hotel, prime location, great value for money","It is the first time I'm staying at the hotel and certainly not the last. The hotel is very close to a metro station and walking distance from Bugis mall. Apart from the great wine bar and the burger house located at the ground floor, there are also many nice restaurants around. Team is very efficient and helped me to check-in/out at no time. The room is small but enough for one person. No noise from outside and good internet coverage. Breakfast is just fine referring to the variety. On the opposite side, the elevators are quit slow and I didn't liked that I had to login for the internet every day. I've had dinner in the burger house and at the wine bar. Burger house was OK while the wine bar was great. Note that a lot of people are coming to the wine bar so either go early or…",40,Jul-19,Travelled on business,1,2,HotelG
Good location. Reasonable prices.,The location of the hotel was very convenient as it was located in town. The prices were also quite reasonable for the hotels location.   The feel and decor of the place had a very mod feel and extremely instagrammable. We liked that there were water coolers on the floor.   The room was cozy and no frills. Not much of a view.   Service was average and the check in wait was somewhat long. Food facilities were good in terms of taste but poor on service. We were pouring our own water. Thankfully we were right next to where they kept the water so it wasn't a long walk to top up our water.,30,Jul-19,Travelled as a couple,1,2,HotelG
Great hotel and location,"Location is perfect and the reception is helpfull and kind. However the service of the F&B services are very poor. Breakfast-, and bar employees were unfriendly and uncapable for the work. Unfortunately they were understaffed, which is not their fault. However it really have an impact on the guest experience. Nevertheless the hotel has a great location and is unique. ",40,Jul-19,Travelled as a couple,1,2,HotelG

Is does not worth to pay for breakfast. I paid 2 day when i got this experience then 2nd day i didn't go to have b/f it waste the money. Room decoration is good but the cleanliness is poor, some stain at bathroom floor and also in the sink.

Small rooms but centrally located,"The rooms are small but perfectly formed and the staff were very accommodating. The hotel is centrally located (Bencoolen and Bugis MRT), close to everything a tourist stopping by needs. However, the cleaning was not quite up to standard, with some hairs in the bathroom. The lights in our room would flash for the first 10 minutes after being turned on, and there is a very insufficient amount of lifts for the number of rooms and floors (3 lifts for 16 floors).

A fully claustrophobic experience,"Staff were helpful. However, I will never return to this hotel. If you come for more than one night, be aware that rooms are 9-m2, that the room can remain untidy until 19.30pm by hotel policies (I returned from a fieldtrip at 17.30pm and the room was yet to be tidied up). Cleaning in the room was poor...with the bed just covered back. Breakfast is diverse but mediocre. Choose some!where else",10,Jul-19,Travelled on business,17,27,HotelG
the most claustrophobic rooms in town,"This hotel is a no go.The hotel has helpful staff but the 9-m2 rooms (fully claustrophobic), the very lax cleaning timing (the hotel policy allows the rooms to be tidy up until 19.30pm), a mediocre-although diverse- breakfast, and q nerve-breaking waiting time for elevators makes this hotel a poor quality-price choice.

Love the scent and deco in general.   Staffs are mostly young and helpful. There's a bar and a restaurant. Only been to each once since I'm always on the go, but both times were pleasant.   Price is a lil above average, but you get what you pay for and room is a little small but that's probably common in Sg.

At later time (night) when I back to the room, they confirmed the bed sheets has been changed to a new one. However, I can still found the old dirt (a few yellow spot (may be Garlic or whatever look disgusting) dye on the same position of the bed sheet, which means they didn't change it!

However we were there at 930 (breakfast ended at 1030) and many of the items were running out (milk, ham, eggs). There were refills but they were slow. Also, there were flies everywhere that landed on my food and the fruit platters. The place was probably short of service staff that caused these issues.

There were random hairs found on my bedding & when I looked through the snack box, there were hairs along the bottom (gross).  Breakfast was an extra surcharge and honestly not with it. The halls were humid and had a moldy smell to it! The walls were paper thin, heard noises all hours of the night.

The only thing is the matter of housekeeping and toiletry / towel provision.  On the first and second day of stay, I was not provided with a tube of shower gel, which I thought was probably not provided to start with.  However a tube a provided on the third day.  The same with floor towel, it was replaced on the third and fourth day, so I had to resort to using the bath towel to wipe the floor dry instead.

Close to the Bugis metro (though it is still a 10’ walk- not ideal with heavy luggage)from where you can hop on the metro to about anywhere in Singapore very easily. The area around the hotel has everything: markets, temples, shops, restaurants and is in walking distance from town centre.  The room I stayed in was compact, but very well organised. It did not feel cramped. There was a big window with a nice view over the city, a compact but pleasant bathroom.   Registration at 2pm is a bit late I find. I am still on the lookout for hotels with more flexible registration hours.",40,Jun-19,Travelled solo,7,12,HotelG
Clean and in good location,Everything was good and I especially liked that there was a French Restaurant at the street level entrance to the Hotel. Rooms were compact but cozy with interesting decor. the only downside was lack of a fridge in the room. Upsides included an in room safe that was big enough to sore a good sized laptop computer.,40,Jun-19,Travelled on business,1,0,HotelG
staff experience is terrible,"during my stay, staffs has been entering my room without any permission. this is rude and disrespect.

Good value for money despite some issues,"Got frustrated about check-in part, early check in at morning, was advised to come back after2pm and when I came back 4pm, room still not available, no definite time for when able to get room nor other solution. Many people and kids stuck at a crowded reception. I was upset by how hotel coped with the situation on the day although finally got sorted around 530pm.  After 3n stay, good location, reasonable price, tidy room. Breakfast includes various options, western and asian, fresh, simple and nice. In the end, hotel offer an airport transfer as apology and I really appreciate.  Will definitely recommend it for good value for money",40,Jun-19,Travelled as a couple,2,2,HotelG

Cool design,"Great location, clean, trendy design of the rooms. I especially liked the mobile provided in the room, which you can take with you and use internet (google, maps) outside of the accommodation to explore the city.

Excellent stay!,"It was my first time staying at Hotel G and it was a very pleasant experience.

I'd only wished there was more selection and variety in the breakfast spread, but it's still pretty decent and standard. A big plus for the hotel is the location. It's close to many different bus stations and MRT stations that can take you conveniently to most places.

Bed was comfortable. AC and ventilation work perfectly, air is cool and fresh. Wifi is very good.  On the negative side, room was very small, not enough place to even put the bags; no real wardrobe as well and table was very small and cramped (I wasn't able to properly work on my laptop). Also lack of refridgerator/minibar and low water pressure, plus water changing temperature by itself all the time were annoying. I was living on top (16) floor, maybe water problems aren't as severe on the other floors.",50,May-19,Travelled solo,1,0,HotelG

Really nice hotel for a city trip,The hotel is nicely decorated and you will find everything you need. Also the location is great. The rooms are really small and it is hard to find space for your cloth. But it is enough for a city trip because you will spend anyways most of the day outside.

Good value and bar set up well suited to solo-travelers,"Good value in my case as I benefited from discounted rates by booking directly with them. French vibes were much appreciated at the ""Ginett"" restaurant and bar downstairs. Overall very good experience despite my critics below.  On the downside, I've found only details: the breakfast buffet is okay but not amazing with a lack of details. As an example, I sometimes struggled to find basic things such as a small spoon, salt and sugar as it was not on the table every day I went to. Also, I had dinner there and I had to ask thrice to pay for the bill. Exhausting where you're tired and you just want to go to bed.

Breakfast was excellent, good range of food, buffet style. Staff are also excellent, very friendly and helpful. Particular thanks for all the help with our flights check in. Our only negative comment is that when we arrived via an airport shuttle (not the hotel's) we were dropped at the back of the hotel instead of at the reception entry in the car park.

My wife and I both have mobility issues and to discover the bed was in an 3 sided alcove which required the person on the inside to exit over the person on the room side was not a good feeling.

The bed is also placed in an awkward position where the second person is required to climb over the first person in order to sleep or get out of the bed. The lights at the entrance and over the sink could not be switched off, thus it was a nightmare to get some decent sleep.

Having said that, with 2 of us staying in the room we still felt we had plenty of space. You can't walk around the double bed because of the wall mounted TV but everything else was fine. Good shower, decent amenities, good lighting & some clever design to maximise space. There was lift maintenance on one of three lifts while we were there resulting in a LOT of waiting around, partly because the cleaners have enormous trolleys that fill the lift.

Great stay in SIngapore,"Great stay in Singapore, I love the design, restaurant and vibe of Hotel G. This was the second time we stayed at one of their properties (first visit in Yangon, one year ago). People complain about the size of the rooms, but it's Singapore and in this price range I still have to find a hotel that offers something bigger. The rooms are very smart designed and, even though there is not a lot of space, we were fine with two people, two large suitcases that could be easily stored under the bed.

Breakfast was good and foods were tasty. I especially love the pastries and sweet section like cookies, pancakes, waffles. It was perfect! But I suggest they could offer more savory items other than egg, it’s a little bit extra for offering fried/scrambled/hard-boiled eggs altogether, something like sausage, hash brown would be even better.  The room was extremely small though I clearly understood that it was the standard type of room.

The location was good and especially with a bus stop in front of the hotel that brings me to places that I wanna go like VivoCity, Marina Bay Sands and etc. The issues I had during my stay was  1. The elevators were slow, it takes a while for the lift to arrive.. but I guess since one lift was under maintenance therefore the issue..  2. The hair dryer in the room.

Style over substance,"I have mixed feelings about this hotel. In a way, it is pretty cool, with an interesting chic design and two buzzy restaurants downstairs. Location wise it is about a 10 minute walk from a shopping mall and 30 minutes walk from Marina Bay. BUT, the staff were really unhelpful and when I had questions were pretty dismissive and condescending. The room itself was absolutely TINY and didn’t have basic things like a wardrobe, or a fridge, which is surprising considering the price tag. And the lift is an absolute joke, it takes on average 7 mins for a lift to arrive from pressing the button. A classic style over substance.

5 Day Stay at HotelG,"A good ambience to the hotel and bar, very friendly staff. Situated in a very central location which is important in Singapore. The rooms were a little on the small side for a couple and not much room to store clothes. We were there to explore Singapore not to stay in a hotel room all day, so on the whole it did the job.

CONS: - Restroom doesn't have exhaust so pretty much it smells like feces once you expel a good amount of dump. - Elevator gets really crowded. Only 2/3 worked when we stayed. - Breakfast buffet (For those who prefer savory food to start the day) is not good. It lacks variety and the flavor of the food is really bland.

I pointed this out in my previous review in 2018 but this still seems to be the case.  I asked the room service lady on my second day during this stay, and she remembers mypreference, and ever since then, every time I see her in the morning and afternoon, she would ask if I have everything I need in my room and if I need extra shower gel.  It's people like her that makes my stay enjoyable.  ",40,Mar-19,Travelled with family,1,0,HotelG

The elevator can drive you nuts in particular if you are in the upper floors. For which reason ever 1 out of 3 lifts is always blocked for other purposes. On the way down it can easily take you 5 minutes from floor 13 to reach the ground. Breakfast was ok, but nothing that I would recommend as really nothing special.

Breakfast was unbelievably poor and disorganised.  We arrived at 9:35am and had to wait for a table (which was not clean), queued for eggs, and then the coffee and then the toast!

The room seems tiny on first entering but it is so very well designed it has nearly everything you need. The only thing we really missed was a fridge. The shower room works well, the washbowl is in the bedroom. We quickly learned that while one moves around, the other sits or lies still, then all is well.

Why could the hotel not pay extra to have maintenance done at night when far fewer guests would need to use the lifts?  Also to have housekeeping using the lifts during the day further complicates the situation.  Not managed very efficiently at all.   Breakfast is just horrible.

It's rather unusual for the lobby / pick-up and drop off to be right at the carpark. The entire setup of the hotel seems to be compact (with basic amenities in the room) albeit with trendy decor. The staff was overall pleasant but a little help to move big luggages to the room would be a nice touch.

One of the worst experiences in Singapore ,"The owners of the hotel clearly spent too much on the concept & design and forgot that a hotel is a service property. To sight a few examples of our stay: vomit on F&B floor during breakfast not cleared until we had personally voiced our disgust, fire alarm went off at 430am for about an hour without a single explanation from the staff and they weren’t even contactable that morning via hotel phone, the bathroom had no floor dividers causing shower waters to seep through into the room and the fireman lift was under maintanence for an entire week to name a few things.

Well priced and well located,"Hotel G has a Tokyo feel. I stayed in a small room, very little real estate for stuff. Decor is quirky and fun, lifts are horribly slow. Be prepared for up to a ten minute wait. The hotel lifts are the same as totally inadequate elevators installed at the Cloud Forest tower over at Gardens by the Bay., so there must have been some back-room dealing by the normally incredibly together Singaporeans to let themselves down by completely under-specifying lifts. If you have multiple devices that need charging via GPOs, the room is under-wired. Only one power socket is available for use with international adaptors, and even that power point must be shared with the kettle. ",40,Feb-19,Travelled solo,1,0,HotelG

Yes the rooms are small but they are also poorly laid out.,"I actually enjoyed my stay at the Hotel G but mostly because I appreciate absurdity.  That said, I wouldn’t stay here again.  It’s true that the rooms are tiny, with the beds slightly lofted and pushed up against the side of the room.  It feels as if you are sleeping in a bathroom where they replaced the bathtub with a bed.  But I have stayed in smaller rooms in Japan and Hong Kong.  My issues are how poorly the rooms (and the hotel) have been designed.  Aesthetically, the rooms are cool, but functionally they make no sense.  There are no bedside tables to put your glasses or water.  There is no light if you want to read in bed.  There is an overhead hanging light but the on/off switch is across the room.

Poor room layout,"Although Hotel G is in a nice area of Singapore near to many places of interest and reasonably priced, the rooms are small and poorly laid out.  We arrived early in the morning and ""upgraded"" for an extra $20/night.  I hate to think what our originally booked room would be like.  There was no closet and no place to put the luggage other than on the floor which made the room even more cramped. The worst of it however was that the bed is on a platform about 15 inches off the floor with virtually no clearance at the end of the bed. This is really awkward in terms of getting out of bed to go to the bathroom during the night as it is almost impossible not to disturb the other person in the bed.  Not recommended for older people especially with limited mobility.  The room was clean…",30,Jan-19,Travelled as a couple,2,0,HotelG
Very slow elevator,We were there for 1 week. One of the 3 elevators was under maintainence for the whole time.  So everytime to go out in rush hours is a 10 min wait to go up or go down. A room service guy said they have to climb stairs at time. But i never seen any maintenance people working.

Nice but could be improved,"Room was comfortable, room amenities were nice and staff was helpful and friendly.The A/c system in my room was hard to control, usually set very cold and could not warm up my room. Elevators take WAY too long, 1 elevator was out of service but I was there for 4 days and it was not fixed, so this might be the case ongoing, it do not seem to be getting service. Lobby was packed, especially during checkout making it a slow process. Entry and exit from the building was inconvenient as you need to enter/exit through the restaurant.

When you enter the restaurant for breakfast, you will say morning, then ask the room number. It is a warm welcome to treat you as a hotel guest.

Breakfast buffet was average, and the wait staff didn't seem like they wanted to be there.

Last orders at the bar were 9:30pm with the bar completely closing at 10:30pm, often of an evening we wanted to enjoy a drink after we got back from dinner but we couldn't do this.

Resting on Laurels …….I will not be back,"I visited around ten years ago and the standards of this fine company have dropped at this location. Having been in the hotel business for over 20 years the British GM has lots of work to do……… Observations on this trip to see the Grand Prix.  It seemed to be a surprise to this hotel that the largest event in the City meant it was full! One of the reasons for booking is the regular shuttle to Orchard road for the MRT. However as occupancy has been low they kept the shuttle at only 4 times in the middle of the day. This is critical when competing against all of the many fine Marina Bay properties  Worse was to follow at Breakfast in The Line…….Huge full hotel and guess how many on duty at the egg station…..ONE Chef……I discussed this with him and another colleague was away on holiday ,over the busiest time the hotel has seen in 3 years ! Amazed in a 5 star hotel no bar open after midnight on arriving back from the city …a lost revenue opportunity indeed.

Outstanding,"We have just spent 12 days at the Shangri-La, and were lucky enough to have a room upgrade from the garden wing to the Valley Wing.  Wow, the room was large and fitted out in luxury.  All the staff were very polite, professional and welcoming.   The room upgrade is actually as it says, you don't get the canapés, cocktails etc, only the room, but it is so much better its worth it.  So Thank you to the Shangri-La for upgrading us on our retirement celebration. The pool is stunning, with lush vegetation all round, colourful birds and beautiful view's.  One slight downfall was the amount of young children running around and screaming whilst in the water, sadly parents not being considerate to other guests, not the hotels fault. We didn't eat in the restaurants due to our financial situation, but taxi's to Orchard Road and hawker centres were cheap and plentiful. This has been the nicest hotel we have stayed at in regards to luxury, whereas the Pan Pacific/Mandarin Oriental are more business orientated. The internal of the whole complex is opulent and all the small touches make it so special, admittedly we were in the Valley wing.  The gardens are stunning. We can highly recommend this hotel, rates are very competitive, but eating in is on the high side (we'll for us they are). Thank you Shangri-La, you certainly made our holiday special and thank you Sally for looking after us in the Summit Room.

Family resort that has seen better days,"There are lots of nice touches and highlight but the hotel has aged and a facelift is needed to bring it up to the expectation one has when staying at well stared resort like the Shangri-La. The check-in and check out process was kind, but very long and cumbersome. It’s a key area that needs up skilling and some tech efficiencies might help. Both processes (excluding waiting time) were 30-40 minutes. An area where the amount of staff didn’t make up for incompetencies. Unlike in the Restaurant, where the team varies in skill but sheer volume does cover up small errors. However on two  occasion we tried with little success to order a beer.

Still a favourite,First time back since covid times. Travelled with a young child and we had an amazing stay overall. We stayed in the garden wing this time and I would say it’s worth the extra for the space and view. Room is clean and well maintained. We tried several f&b outlets while staying here and all the food was good. My son had a great time at splash and buds. The normal pool is also in good condition and not too crowded. All the staff were very attentive and kind to my son and our requests were generally promptly attended to. Only negative was that our bags took almost an hour to be brought to our room after check in and we had to follow up. Will stay again!

The bed is angled in the room, which isn’t the best use of space and made an already small room seem smaller. Also, they had slippers in the room but no robes, which seemed odd. Perhaps housekeeping missed it? There was coffee and water in the room, which we appreciated. After checking in we went down to the lobby bar for a drink and a snack, and we never saw our server again after placing our order. Found and drinks came, but had to chase someone down for the check.

Not for families with younger children,"Children below the age of 4 are only limited to the ball pits at buds. They are unable to go on most of the slides. Did not manage to book splash as there were no slots available. If you plan to book splash i believe you'll need to stay 2 night minimum to secure a slot due to the high demand and low supply. If one were to book 2 nights just for a session at splash it would be better to look at the buds annual membership and gain access to their pool without having to stay in their rooms. Good enough beds but way dated decor. But that is only because i was staying in the garden wing.   I believe i would have a better experience if my kids are aged 7 and above.

Like being on a crowded cruise ship,"Pros (1) Splash the outdoor water playground was fun with plenty for kids to do (2) Buds the indoor playground was fun too with an art room (3) The steak and Italian restaurants were good (4) Room was big with a huge bathroom.  Cons (1) Super crowded and hotel could not cope sometimes  (2) 1 hour wait for food at first breakfast. Kitchen was overwhelmed and all the guests had to wait a long time for their food. (3) Check in was chaotic. I was told to sit at a table and be called when it was my turn but that did not happen. Other people were allowed to cut queue. (4) Check in counter staff could not help to book activities. Therefore, check in took long as time had to be spent on my phone booking each activity. (5) Room was a bit dated.

Excellent Breakfast Meeting at Lobby Lounge -  Good at Making Things Right,"Hosted breakfast at Lobby Lounge as a non-staying GC guest. The spread and quality of food was good, with a minor gripe being that the bread basket off the set wasn’t as much a basket as it was single serving. Nonetheless the service was warm and friendly, and the location and environment was excellent for a working breakfast.   The Shangri-La guest services team responded well to an issue with GC points and voucher redemptions. There might have been some misinformation and confusion amongst staff as I was advised by Lobby Lounge crew that while GC point redemptions were not possible on a PH eve, GC vouchers would be accepted.

Good break with the family,"We have stayed at this hotel several times, but the children appear to never tire of it. It feels like right now, it is one of the best places for a staycation for families with young children.  Really can't find much to complain about over our 3-night stay. Most things went smoothly and without fuss or drama, which I always appreciate greatly while taking a break from work.   The room in the Valley Wing, while slightly dated, was spacious even for our family of four. The housekeeping staff did a good job of helping us keep things neat and tidy through our stay. I also liked that they were discreet, and picked all the right moments to come and clean our room - which is not necessarily the case at some other hotels we have been to.

Pleasant staff with excellent service,"Our first stay at Shangri La @ Orange Grove was a wonderful experience. I have to say the service here is top notch and impressive. Every staff we spoke to was well equipped with property knowledge, and were able to answer any enquiries we had. Any requests we had, they fulfilled with ease. Whenever we called about an issue (such as the TV being faulty), they were quick to send someone to fix it. Not only that, but they also called back afterwards to follow up and ensure that the issue had been solved.  Upon check-in, the lady at the front desk, I believe her name is Farah? noticed that it was my partner's birthday and wished him a happy birthday without any of us mentioning it.

Valley Wing Hit and Miss,"Stayed one night at the Valley Wing - the most elite of their rooms and 'club' type experience. The service was hit and miss. Hits were the older men in dark suit jackets who appear to be more senior and were jovial, entertaining and fantastic at treating the customers to a luxury experience. Then there were clearly the 'newbies' - one young man admitted it was his 2nd day and that's why he didn't know the answers to any queries - this was fine, we all have to learn but probably not great to have him train at the Valley Wing. However, there appeared to be 'intermediate' staff level who appeared confident but were misinformed and therefore made the experience quite unpleasant. We booked breakfast slot at 10:45 to 12. The alcohol beverage service starts at 11am but when we asked…",30,Nov-21,Undisclosed,1,0,ShangriLa

We found glass fragments in the room that my hubby accidentally stepped onto it and small cut at the sole. Furthermore, I was charged wrongly my klook set menu that was already prepaid.

Great Hotel but.....,"The hotel is very kids friendly with fantastic facilities. The hotel staff was also very helpful and friendly. There is a bakery at the hotel and we were however very disappointed with the staff named Elsa. We have a $50 dining credit and decided to spend at the bakery. When we were at the cashier she told us that the total amount was $40+. We told her we would like to get a just one more  item to add. She gave an annoyed look, threw our receipt in the paper bag and turned to the next customer. We were shocked by such rude attitude. My 7 year old kept asking why she behaved in such a way after we left the bakery. I wished he didn't have to witness such attitude.

After giving my feedback, I received an invitation from the hotel, inviting me to come back with my family to a complimentary 1-D stay.  I took up the invitation and asked if a complimentary birthday cake can be given for my October stay because we wanted to celebrate my mother's birthday this time.

They were good with children and would often engage them - made the children feel very special. The all-day champagne and high tea/canapes were excellent; we liked the options for breakfast too. Raja was our favourite butler as he made every effort to look after us.   We enjoyed our time at Splash; but Buds was so-so as it catered more to younger children (probably seven and below). Overall, the playcation package was value-for-money, especially at the Valley Wing.",50,Aug-21,Travelled with family,78,93,ShangriLa

Bad pool experience ,"We had a family stay and of all Shangri-La hotels that I have stayed in, this was the poorest by far. The unpleasant parts: - bad staff behavior by patrolling staff at the pool. I was rudely pointed at and told by a woman in a polo t-shirt uniform to wear my mask even when I had a drink with me near the pool bar. It’s ok to tell the guests but rudeness can never be tolerated   - after each designated hour at the pool, whistles were being blown to get the people out of the pool. We are paying guests and not at a boot camp so this way of telling guests is just not acceptable. Other hotels do this much more gracefully by their staff just giving the guests gentle reminders of the time left.  - pool lounge chairs were filthy and should have been replaced long time ago  - room in the…",20,Mar-21,Undisclosed,58,93,ShangriLa

A Sweet experience Turned Sour (High-Tea),"Writing this without any ill intention, but just to share sincere feedback hoping that the management of Shangri-La Singapore would take my feedback for improvements.   Long story short, I ordered a Rose Veranda high tea set to be delivered as a birthday surprise to my friend late May 2021, but due to various operational hiccups which I did not expect to happen in a luxury hotel, my order was missed and was not delivered, despite myself following up with the hotel before the agreed delivery time, to which the PIC provided sound assurance that my order will be delivered as scheduled.

All items have to be ordered from room service and is chargable. If the hotel is trying to minimise guest contact because of Covid, it would be better for the hotel to stock up the complementary minibar at check in and make it non-refillable.

A legendary experience that was truly noteworthy,"It was truly truly an EXTRAORDINARY experience! Shangri-La Hotel Singapore embraces technology, and the use of a QR code to send requests to the hotel is such great convenience, making the stay truly comfortable. The Valley Wing all day champagne is such a winning formula - the staff were generous, forthcoming and attentive. The hotel pays great attention to detail and its impact of her customers was just so hard to quantify. One can't help but marvel at pleasant smelling orchids everywhere and the amenities in the room were just so well thought through. Keep up the good work!",50,May-21,Undisclosed,3,5,ShangriLa

Family Fun Playcation was no fun,"Booked this to celebrate the mister’s birthday and picked this hotel over others as I was also sold by the unique kids experience - Buds indoor playground + Splash Zone.

The onus is on you to book slots on a first come first serve basis, yet being able to do so only on-site (3pm is check in which they have issues fulfilling - we got our room close to 4.30pm)   It was only through Calista’s help that we were able to at least get a Buds slot on the evening of our arrival (all slots of buds & splash zone were fully booked).

We took our toddler to Buds, the soft play area, and to the Splash Zone. He loved both. He also got a goody bag on arrival with toys, activities and a little pair of Shangri-La slippers.

As it was a long weekend, buds and splashzone were quite fully booked but they manage to squeeze us in. While getting the welcome drinks, my girl fell on the way and she cheered her up by getting her color pencils and chicken wings. It was a very kind gesture.

February stay: After a superb stay experience over the New Year weekends, we immediately booked another stay in end February under Valley Wing Indulgence package. It was just an ordinary weekend and the occupancy didn’t seem to be as full as compared to our New Year stay. However, I felt that it was rather understaffed. During evening cocktails, it took quite a long while for everything to be served.

Room was not ready when we checked in at 3.00. Only got our key to the room at around 4.15pm.  Unable to give us a late check out to compensate for the delaycheck in.  In my view, this is not the service one expects from a brand like the shangrila.  Room was a bit dated but that’s OK as room was reasonably clean. However the kettle in the room did not switch off by itself. We only discovered the defect when we realised that the kettle had boiled itself dry! Poor QC? Could be a potential safety hazard.

Also, they have implemented a booking for usage of the pool which is better to ensure that the number of pax is manageable, though this meant that you may not necc be able to get the pool at your preferred time. overall I enjoyed the experience  and especially the massage! :)",40,Mar-21,Undisclosed,63,30,ShangriLa

The strange thing is, the doorman came to open the car door for me as I alighted my Tada and then...... immediately turned around to walk away without offering any assistance with my luggage and laptop. A rather patchy service start  My room was ready, and I was given my welcome letter stating the Valley Wing benefits. I was also given a late(r) check out of 1pm from the original 12pm. My other letter explaining the USD100 dining credit was later slipped under my door.  Room - I am all for modern luxury than old school opulence but I really liked my Valley Wing Deluxe King (57SqM)!

Enjoyable with room for improvements,"Had a 3D2N stay at the hotel with my wife and 1-year old kid.   Room was spacious and clean. Although im doubting if there should be 2 tables in the room. 1 coffee table just by the sofa and another dining table(i assume) just in front of it. The bed however was a totally different story. It was hard as a rock and the pillows, while they looked super fluffy, were almost flat upon lying your head on them. The sleep quality could have been better.   The hotel is indeed family friendly with loads of facilities catered to kids like buds, splash zone and even a section of the swimming pool catering to kids. Check in and check out were a breeze.

The most premium wing of the 3 towers; had lived up to its reputation; but with a few reservations.   But let’s focus on the positives first.  The deluxe room was clean & very spacious. A bit dated but still acceptable for those of a more matured generation. A bottle of red wine, assorted box of chocolates & a platter of fresh fruit was appreciated as with their luxury L’Occitane toiletries.   The service button was always promptly answered; despite The Valley Wing being 70% occupied.   The legendary ala carte breakfast was the highlight.

Children centric and possibly Chinese tourist friendly.,"I seldom write reviews unless I’m extremely free, it’s 7am and I have been tossing around in bed.   Now, it’s staycation season in Singapore and many locals are looking for a getaway. Full of rave reviews here about great service and how kids are so happy here. I wish to cover something more basic or what a traveler is looking for.  The bed is firm and it’s totally reminds me of hotel beds in China hotels. The interior is old whole grandeur / resort which also is a very popular interior choice of Chinese hotels in China. Maybe because I usually book newly build hotels that are modern, edgy and hip so that I can observe new interior trends, materials and new design. This totally feels like the type of hotel my China suppliers will book for us. Feels very on the road for me.  ",40,Jan-21,Travelled with family,97,36,ShangriLa

Although we couldn’t choose what to eat but it was sufficient as we couldn’t ask for me. This is customer service at its best! NB: There were a few staff that simply ignored us.

I must say Arnold made a big difference and helped allay some fears as we read about overbooking of buds and splash zone.   Buds is the indoor playground, and the staff there were very friendly to my kids (3 and 6), even remembering their name. Kids enjoyed it very much and kept running around  Splash Zone is the outdoor water play zone and it’s fun enough to keep the kids running round and round the slides.  Staff was friendly and helped us change room when the first room did not come…",50,Oct-20,Travelled with family,1,2,ShangriLa
"Elegant hotel, charming service ","Booked the Valley Wing Indulgence staycation deal for a friend’s hen weekend, the Shangri-La vastly exceeded expectations! This was my first staycation since hotels started reopening and I’d been worried about references to having an allotted check-in time, luckily we didn’t need to worry and got checked in without issue, and pleasantly surprised to be upgraded and for a beautiful surprise left in the room for my friend.   As others have said, Valley Wing stays include breakfast, all-day drinks, afternoon tea, and evening canapés. I’d not had high expectations of the setting or catering but the Lobby lounge was beautiful, and service was great - really nice to while away an afternoon here, especially sitting outside.

A Fun Playcation,"We booked a couple staycation and family playcation back to back as the packages seemed very value for money and I'm glad that we did. Check-in took a little time, but was due to the nature of our back to back packages - but the check-in counter staff were very happy to accommodate. We were two adults with a toddler and a baby, and the combination of the splash zone and budz made it the first choice in family staycation options.   We booked the garden wing with pool view which came with a large balcony to relax on after the kids were asleep. The room itself was large, although the decor probably needs a refresh. Bathroom was large and have separate shower and bath, which was great in giving the kids baths.

Mediocre service and unable to reserve dining,"1. As part of the package we were given dining vouchers which we were told mist be utilised during our stay. But when we tried to reserve, all restaurants were fully booked! In our experience, at least hotels like MBS and RWS bothered calling and sending out email reminders on making early dining reservation. Nothing from shangri la and all restaurants full, how did you expect guest to utilise their vouchers?  2. We had 2 day entry to BUDs for our little one. Prior to check in I had called to ask but staff insisted I needed to check in first. When we arrived, again we were told no slots were available for day 1.

The breakfast, high tea, canapés and drinks throughout the day were all included in the package. It was all served in the Lobby or the Summit room.

In the process of my move to Singapore, I stayed in the serviced hotel and that was fun because we could visit the swimming pool at the main hotel. The frog pool was a small outdoor water play-area the first time I visited but now it has evolved into the much bigger Splash Zone which has a pool, water-play pirate ship and more things to play around on.

Staycation with Family!,"We stayed for 3D2N. The room is great, very spacious and comfortable. It was my birthday and I got a cake waiting in the room!❤️    We didn’t get to go to splash zone because the slots that we wanted were already full. It was Phase 2 in Singapore so the number of people that can get in is limited. We get to use the main pool though and my kids still enjoyed our stay!  The only downside is the food. Breakfast was the same everyday and the taste was average. I guess I just expected more from Shangrila. We also had In room dining and even that, the food I would say is not worth it. We stayed in Shangrila sentosa before and the food there was better.    We will still probably come back here after Covid is gone.  ",40,Sep-20,Travelled with family,52,32,ShangriLa

Restaurants were a tad pricey for local grub and had large portions but service was TOP notch all the way, very catered to a family with young kids like us.

Firstly if you drive, you may choose to park at the Valley Wing side, and it's like a private carpark that you'll appreciate the proximity to the Valley Wing lobby.  Perhaps it was because we stayed during the National Day long weekend, there was a crowd at the Lobby Lounge when we went down for afternoon tea and cocktail/canape. Afternoon tea was a nice selection of pastries, sandwiches and scones, paired with a palatable champagne - Veuve Clicquot.

Used to be the best in the world - not now,"My wife and I have stayed at the Shangri-la every two or three years since 1987.   For many years, it was the hotel of choice for professionals, especially when staying in the Horizon Club.   For the extra cost, one got excellent well-appointed rooms, and a degree of exclusive service in the breakfast and Club areas  On our recent trip, we found that the room had been redesigned, probably by someone who had never stayed there.  The bathroom is smaller, with the shower in a so-called wet-room area with a slippery floor, which could be dangerous.

Only complaint about the breakfast is the coffee service.  You can make much better coffee by yourself using Nespresso machines which are available there.  Room and bathroom very nicely renovated. Only complain in that sector comes from the age of the hotel. Almost 50 years ago room height was lower and there is not enough natural light in the room.  One thing I suggest is please remove those large writing desks which are totally blocking the windows and takes the last spacious feeling away.

"Hotel is great, but block booking sucks.",The hotel facilities and staff are great. But doing a block booking for a seminar for overseas visitors was not as smooth as I had expected. I had chosen Shangri La based on my past great experience staying there and was disappointed with the standard of the booking system that I had to intervened on behalf of my overseas guests. I had envisioned that once the special booking code was allocated all my guests would be able to do their own bookings. Unfortunately there were hiccups along the way and I was embarrassed after having informing them this is one of Singapore's best.Luckily once everyone arrived the seminar proceeded well.,40,Nov-19,Travelled on business,93,70,ShangriLa

1 star in service,This appearance of this hotel was grand. However the services from check in and ALL the restaurants were AWFUL! We would get our main course before the appetizers. Our kids food would come out last. The waiters would forget to bring certain plates.. We had to make several reminders to waiters inquiring about late plates.

Apart from a few minor changes, it's remained the same. It is still as impressive as my first visit. The staff are efficient, friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious and come equipped with everything you could possibly need. Great products in the bathroom too. I went to two of the restaurants this time and they were both excellent.

Being pure vegetarian it was difficult to find many options for breakfast. Luckily Chef Dilip Nayak and his team made their best efforts to assist us. He particularly requested for our Indian food demands and made delicious Indian Masala Tea, Uttapam, Chole and all for all of us.

Disappointing that multiple items on the pool menu aren’t available: today for example, both Rose wine options weren’t available and none of the four smoothies on menu were available.

The sofa bed that comes in the room is extremely handy, it folds out to a very comfortable and low lying bed for the 5 year old, we didn't have to worry about her rolling off. I always have to build some sort of fort on the side of any rollaway beds to create a barrier for the 5 year old so that she wouldn't roll off, but this sofa bed did not require it.

Lovely hotel but just not quite as good as it used to be,"First up:  this has to be the loveliest smelling hotel lobby. I want my house to smell this beautiful. Sell the scent - guests would buy it and be reminded of the hotel.   We stayed in interconnecting rooms, which was fabulous. The Garden Wing is lovely as you have outside walkways around a garden area leading to the rooms. The rooms are well equipped. One day we can hope that the televisions in hotel rooms allow for streaming services, but the big hotels aren’t there yet. Some smaller ones are doing this and it is a great move.

Stay where Obama stays,"When there is a important event going on in Singapore, chances are that the who’s who will stay here. A few cab drivers said Obama recently stayed here.   An Uber classy 5star hotel just outside the city center so it’s feels very green rather than urban. Yet still everything from Raffels to markets to the gardens is only a $6 cab ride away.  Our family of 5, teenagers mum dad and mother-in-law, all loved this place.  I think the accommodation itself was outstanding and very good value but as is the case with all 5star hotels (particularly in Singapore), the restaurants and drinks poolside etc are very expensive.

It was indeed a pleasant experience. I have booked the Garden wing - Deluxe room for celebration of my wedding anniversary. The room is spacious with the view of the swimming pool and garden. We had a wonderful time enjoying the peace and comfort of nature and yet so near to the city. However, there was a glass dining table with 2 chairs that was in the middle of our room which seems a bit out of place.  We had a good stroll in the morning at the garden and enjoyed the nice orchid shelter at the back of the garden.

Is the Valley Wing worth the extra expense?,"This is the question I now ask myself.

So to be fair I got the room at a discount and thank you Shangri La.  The Valley Wing is beautifully presented with extremely friendly staff.  It offers an open bar from 11am till 10:30 and regular snacks.  The area is peaceful and smart, and if that is what you want then the Shangri La is a superb hotel.  But i would have prefered my Garden Wing Balcony Suite with a pool view.  The Valley Wing offers you your own private dinning room for breakfast.

It exceeded all of our expectations, and we had very high expectations after staying in very good hotels in the past. No one as good as this one. The room was absolutely amazing and comfortable, always clean and someone came to check if we need anything every day, the buds for kids was very helpful for us as family with children. The fact that this is also very family oriented was major consideration for us. The friendly staff and the check in process. Even though we arrived early, we were taken immediately to the lounge and were allowed to use all facilities. Didn’t happen to me in any hotel so far where nothing was allowed before room was ready and official check in time.

I used to stay in the hotel almost every year some years back. And it is delightful to see that the services have remained as friendly and efficient as ever. I noticed though that the food selection during breakfast has decreased. The airconditioning throughout the hotel, whether in the Valley Wing or main tower is also just too cold for comfort. Perhaps, they should consider putting the thermostat a bit. Not only will that save on energy, it will also make guests more confortable.

I got intrigued with their a la carte menu since their buffet was spot on.  I called on one of their cooks that always strolls around the place and checking the food and I asked which one is best. Ms. Carolyn suggested the seafood pasta and true enough it was one of the best I have ever had.  I will be back for more dining and ambiance experience at Shangri la Orchard. Especially the restaurant.  Cheers!",50,Aug-19,Travelled on business,1,2,ShangriLa
Superb hospitality from concierge ,"My family and friends were at Shangri la Singapore  to dine at The Line. After dinner we approached the concierge, Johnny at the lobby to help us to take a photo. He not only kindly obliged, but even recommended to assist to take more than 1 shot at various spots that were ""Shangri-la signature"" in the lobby. After which, he proceeded to engage with my child and gave her toy. It was excellent service given that we only required a simple photo. But he went above and beyond to put a smile on his guests. It is truly a privilege to have him as your staff. For recognition purpose, I was there on 9 September at around 9.45pm.  Thanks Johnny! You have given us memories of a lifetime in the few photos.

Memorable to the detail,"This is a much delayed review for a night staycation that my wife and 6 years old daughter went 3 months ago in June 2019.  I'd like to commend the staff at check-in counter at that time. My wife was queueing for checking-in and it was busy afternoon with a lot of people queuing. My wife stayed in the queue and had to watch my daughter at the same time. The staff recognized this and they gave them priority. To my daughter's delights, they gave her a squirrel plush toy named ""chubby"".

The genuine, helpful, warm, friendly but professional but service is what you can and will receive.  Shangri-La is my home.   During this visit, I have spent many hours in the hotel and the outlets (namely Origin and Waterfall).  Remember to ask the Chef Daniel from Waterfall for the special menu of the day.

I was so glad that I brought my wife on one of my longer stays. I would also go to the Shangri-La on Sentosa but I don't think I ever spent the night.

Still the standard in Singapore,"I come to Shangri-La in Singapore since 1986. It was at that time one of the only 5-star superior hotels with a more than excellent standard in service and accommodation.This has continued until today. The only negative point I can say is, that their award system ""Golden Circle"" and their reservation system did not work properly in my first 20 years with Shangri-La Hotels (Singapore and many other I have been), and so at least 20 Stays were not counted. Nevertheless I like Shangri-La and will come back - however certainly in less quantity as I am retired now and don't travel as much as before.",50,Jul-19,Travelled on business,54,92,ShangriLa

I would especially like to commend Andreano, Roy, Tina, Aoi and ShiRui for their fantastic service! They all surprised me with a bday cake and multiple desserts and sang a happy bday song!!! All of my sisters were impressed from the way they treated us, like family. Everyone was so warm and made me feel special. The food is spectacular as is the ambience, but what really sets the restaurant apart from all the others are their staff who really reaches out to connect with you. This is of course all possible as the team is well led by Andreano, who hosted us and who was such a delight! Thank you all so much!",50,Jul-19,Travelled with family,57,62,ShangriLa
Amazing hotel with superb service ,"Stayed in the garden wing late last month with couple of friends. The room was indeed spacious and comes with a big balcony, something rare in other hotels met by the land scarcity of Singapore.   For service wise, it's definitely big plus, was escorted by Ariff, he's attentive and humorous.

Gems Hunting ,"This was our very first time staying at the Shangri-la Singapore. It was established in 1971 and partly refurbished in 2017. Surprisingly, it was very well maintained in all aspects. The entrance and the lobby area was spacious and elegant. There were also some unique artworks and crafted plantations which, were nicely presented around the welcome area. It will definitely tempt you to turn on your camera mode.   We were being assigned to the refurbished side (I think) of the property.  However, we didn't quite enjoy the weird shape of the room and my gut was telling me I would not have a restful night if I stayed in that room. They were kind enough to move us to the garden wing which was a normal sized room with a balcony facing the pool. Our porter, Elvis, was helpful…",50,Jun-19,Travelled on business,877,101,ShangriLa

Our room was an unusual design with the bed on an angle.  We didn't like the layout it was difficult to move around, it was lovely and clean. The view from the room was nice.  The staff were wonderful especially in the Horizon Club lounge.  This hotel is extremely busy, especially the Foyer.  Heaps of choices from the buffet breakfast.

The rooms are all well appointed and maintained and the very few times I've had a room need the hotel was immediate in their response, going well above to ensure I was taken care of.    The property is a refuge that I have come to appreciate more and more.  Being an easy stroll to Orchard but still on it's own, I find the relaxing environment perfect after long days working or touring the city.

Disappointing second stay at a previous personal world favourite hotel,"Beautiful property with tropical gardens, gorgeous scultpures, fountains. Check in was excellent and was given Garden Wing room overlooking pool with large balcony, BEAUTIFUL.  The pool is one of my all time favourites and in the early morning and sometimes in the late afternoon it was the perfect place to relax.  However, by mid-morning and throughout the day, miss behaved children made the experience less than pleasant. There were two large events going on at the property and it appeared at entitled children overtook the property, restaurants and facilities.  No supervision from the parents and no one from the hotel told the children to stop running up and down the lobby escalators or crash jump into the swimming pool near a relaxed floating adult.

The tropical gardens in the middle of the city are simply stunning and an oasis of peace and quiet. Some suites or rooms give you access to the Club that is located on the top floor of the main tower and that serves tea and pre-dinner cocktails with a lovely view over Singapore, night or day time.

We brought our baby boy along and the hotel provided a steriliser and bottle warmer upon request. The baby mattress and cot is nice and soft unlike many other hotels.

This very personal touch sets this property apart from all other properties in the world. It goes without saying that the spacious rooms, impeccable room servicing, extensive facilities with lots of green space and a very nice breakfast leave nothing to be desired during the stay.

Beautiful hotel but a bit off the beaten track (Orchard Rd.),"This is a beautiful hotel, with well appointed and well maintained rooms. The hotel pool is large and lovely. The only disadvantage of this hotel is that it is a bit off the beaten track: it is a good 5 to 10 min. walk from Orchard Rd. and another 5 min. to the metro station. That doesn't sound far (it isn't) but it is hot! in Singapore. If you want to see any of the sights in Singapore other than the shopping on Orchard Rd., this hotel is a bit less convenient that some others. But if you want a quiet getaway in the city, this may be right for you. The Chili Crab in the Lobby Lounge was a delightful surprise! It was the best we found in Singapore (small, but delicious).",50,May-19,Travelled as a couple,102,86,ShangriLa

The city/state of Singapore is exotic to many for sure, and the Shangri-La Hotel helps define this great place. The service was exceptional, and being walked to my room by the person checking you in was a new experience, who then went over my accommodations with me.  I only ate breakfast at the hotel, but is was excellent, and the selections by culture were impressive to see, that wherever you were from they had you taken care of.

Stunning lobby,"We've stayed at this beautiful hotel a few times now (Tower Wing). We always return due to the wonderful service in the Horizon Club.  The Club is very comfortable, welcoming and the food is of a high quality.  We stayed in the same rooms (interconnecting for our teenager children) again but really found them too small. It wasn't something we could overlook this time.  They also looked tired. The view was of a large concrete looking building. It was probably highlighted more this visit as we also stayed at another hotel near the marina which had magnificent views and also had much larger rooms.  Also, the hotel was more family focussed (younger children), with the introduction of a water park and also specific areas in the Horizon Club and main restaurant separated for kids.

Little things like the reception remembering your name and staff at the omelet bar remembering your order added a personal VIP touch.   Massage at the Chi spa was a wonderful experience, as was afternoon tea at the Rose Veranda.  Only slight niggles were the pool closing time - 8pm. This should be extended as we missed out most night having come back late. It also felt like the pool was being closed around you at half 7 with staff running a cordon around you.

Rooms are a little small but for Singapore standard, it's not bad.  Fully equiped with all essentials, all you have to do is ask if there is anything else you might have forgotten to bring with you from home.   Definitely book the Horizon Club as I always do.

Fantastic Club Level Experience,"Really enjoyed my stay at the club level for a personal holiday.  Atmosphere and personal touches in the lounge were among the top in the city.  Attentiveness of the staff was a highlight.  Chef Ashok stood out, quite perceptive of my dietary restrictions.  The room was quite comfy and housecleaning staff went out of the way to keep things neat.  Hospitality team was thorough and overall was a great experience.  I’ll be back for sure.  On the negative side for a personal holiday the pool was quite hectic and filled with families, hard to find space to swim, though I realize the hotel is geared for families so I was glad we had booked the club since no kids allowed after 6:30 PM :-).  Next time I come with my family, I’m sure my kids will love it here.  ",50,May-19,Travelled solo,15,24,ShangriLa

The lobby, the grounds and the common areas are beautiful. The kid's club is awesome. Parents of young children would be thrilled to drop off their kiddos there for a few hours so they could have some relaxing time by the pool. We upgraded to a Club room and got a decent size room. The room amenities are very good, e.g. quality bedding, big and fluffy towels, quality toiletries, full size hair dryer etc. Now on to the ""not so good"".  The Club Lounge buffet is not as sumptuous and does not have a good variety of food as some of the Club lounges in Asia that we've been to, especially in Vietnam.

So upon going in to the room the kids amenities were not their and I had asked for it after the next day because I thought maybe they have forgotten which wasn’t the case last time. Today is my last day here so from check in till now no one ever comes to my room for evening service even if they do they don’t put anything.

Excellent Staff,"We quite often stop at Singapore for a few days on our way to Australia and when we do we always stay at Raffles but, unfortunately they are still in the process of an overhaul and were not taking any bookings at the time so, we decided to stay at the Shangri-La and upgrade to a suite. The hotel is obviously vastly different to Raffles and cannot begin to be compared to it as that would be unfair so I will just review this based on it as a stand alone hotel. It is very modern and clean, the suite we stayed in (garden suite) was nice but not as big as some suites we have stayed in during our travels (Emirates palace, Abu Dhabi for example) but it was well laid out and the flower covered balconies are a nice touch.

The location is an easy walk to the top end Orchard shops and MRT but the lobby is also well served for taxis, you never have to wait long. This is a business hotel but also a family hotel.

  Very Good ,We have stayed here several times before but this is our first since the refurbishment. The refurbishment is excellent and the usual high standard of service was evident once again Thank you. We stayed during Chinese New Year so the hotel was extremely busy. Were were in the Horizon Club in the Tower Wing and it is a lot more family orientated since the refurbishment with the result that there was a lot more children. We were two adults travelling alone. It was wonderful to see the families having such fun. If you want a less lively stay surrounded by less children then I suggest you stay in the Valley Wing. We have stayed there before and will revert to it when we are back later in the year.

"Unremarkable hotel, out of the way for shopping and attractions","Not in the Marina Bay area or within walking distance of Orchard Road shopping, though remodeled, this vast 850 or so  room hotel would not have been my first choice, having stayed at several other hotels and clubs on prior visits to Singapore.  We were booked for a one night pre-cruise stay included in our cruise fare. Our room in the tower wing had the king bed at a peculiar angle to accommodate a not too large room with a not to large bathroom, both of which appear to have been recently remodeled.  The view from this seventh floor room of a roof top was not particularly inviting.  Breakfast was equally unremarkable in a vast and unattractive buffet restaurant.  I don't know what the cruise line paid, but I would feel cheated if I were paying at the rack rate.",30,Jan-19,Travelled as a couple,168,96,ShangriLa

This hotel is SO thoughtful. We stayed 1 week on an Executive Floor in the Tower wing. Rooms were small but everything was well laid out and everything worked so well. Enough power points, with multi-charger outlets and USB ports. The lighting works really well with subtle night lighting so that small children aren't afraid at night but it's low level enough that the adults aren't kept awake by it. There are thoughtful tables and chairs for when I needed to work. Then, the second week (we went somewhere else and came back), we stayed on one of the family floors. This is just amazing.

Tower Wing is the main hotel where the grand reception welcomes you. I believe this is the Family wing as you have a mini Kidzania at lower ground. The pool shared by 3 wings are beautiful but service does not justify the luxury feel of the pioneering Shangri-La.

Was this really necessary when the customer was not even requesting for that? That left such a horrible first impression on the hotel.

Miserably small room,"The room was so small that it was difficult for two people to maneuver and hard to deal with luggage.  Since there was no place to really store anything, we had to live out of our suitcases, but there was really no place to put them.  There is only one ""nightstand"" as the sink is on the other side of the bed in the room.  And there is one wet area that houses both the toilet and shower.  If you check out early, they still charge you for not giving 48 hour notice.   Felt like it was more like a hostel than a hotel room.  It did have a safe and refrigerator and excellent TV selection but those items did not make up for the ridiculously small size.",20,Jun-22,Undisclosed,86,6,Yotel

"Ridiculously soft bed, cramped room, ants crawling around, dim walkway from the L2 elevator to the lobby","I stayed here for 1 night and was thankful it was only for 1 night. The rooms were very small, like the average size of a Hong Kong hotel room small. Ironically, with the same price I can get a bigger hotel room in HK. There was barely enough room to walk around the room with the TV so close to the bed once the reclining bed (similar to beds in the hospital) is placed down. There isn't a proper door know to the toilet, it's just a little stub that extends from the glass for you to grab. The bathroom sink is right next to the bed.  There were ants crawling on the wall.

Location is very convenient for travelers who enjoy food, shopping and may be a movie.  Our room was in a higher floor and with the glass façade in the toilet, the view was amazing. However, when we actually do the business in the toilet we had to close it with the curtain (for obvious reasons like privacy).    The food is also reasonably good. We only had the breakfast (Buffet) and it was good.  Although the buffet was not very big, it had a good set of options. They were good in flavor too.

Excellent Location. Cool Experience,"Hotel is nice and clean, location is excellent. Rooms are small but still comfortable. Staffs are friendly and accommodating.   We had an issue with the lock on our room, I had to go down the lobby to have the key fixed but ultimately the door did not open and we had to transfer rooms. It was a little bit of hassle because we were already tired from the tour and we still had to pack and change rooms. but the staff handled the situation nicely.   Bed is too soft or maybe worn out already. When you lie down the mattress flattens and does not hold shape, so for me who is used to sleeping on a semi firm mattress it was a little uncomfortable.

The room smells like damp as the bathroom is a wet room and there’s no extractor fan or window that opens.  Overall the hotel is fine, parts of the room are well done, others could do with improvement like sockets and a shelf on both sides of the bed, and a shelf for your clothes in the bathroom as it’s one big wet room.

The bed was a motorised type that can be raised from about half of its length or dropped down flat. The facilities are compact but perfectly fine for most short term trips. The shower and toilet were next to a full-length clear glass wall with a view of the nearby buildings - meaning they can see you too - so there are two built-in blinds to give either partial or total screening.

Overall enjoyed the stay in this hotel as it is  strategically located around eateries, shopping malls, theatre, and buffet outlets along Scotts Rd.  Parking is not free at the hotel. Rooms are slightly small and congested. Housekeeping is available once every four days of stay. However mineral water and clean towels are available upon request.",40,May-22,Undisclosed,2,0,Yotel
Great stay but rooms on the small side,Overall a great stay smack in the heart of Orchard Road. The deal breaker was the size of the room. It is the smallest luxury room that I've ever stayed at.  Rooms are super clean and the deco is definitely instagrammable.,40,May-22,Undisclosed,50,82,Yotel
Clean and compact. Not for big groups. Service was just okay.,"Clean pad, but it’s ideal for people who want to spend the whole day out and come back to a clean room to crash in because of how small it is.   The service at front desk was unhelpful as the staff we dealt with was new and didn’t communicate well even when asked simple questions like, “What’s the problem?” when they were experiencing difficulties with our check-out process. So that was a little frustrating.   The breakfast included in our stay was nice.   We enjoyed our stay overall. ",40,May-22,Undisclosed,1,0,Yotel
Good location & Value for money,"I would definitely stay here again. Good location in town and affordable rooms. The walls seem quite thick cuz I can’t hear any noise from the other rooms. Love the decor. The bed, pillows & air conditioning is perfect! Would have been better if could connect to Netflix but having a TV in the room itself is amazing. The view outside from the toilet is breathtaking hehe",50,May-22,Undisclosed,2,0,Yotel
Great location and price but room too small,Can't actually fault anything about the Hotel other than the room was too small but what should I have expected - it was called a Pod - and I can see why. The view from the bathroom was great and the bed very comfortable however I needed to do a fair bit of work on my laptop and there was absolutely no where to do this in the room - I had to go down to the Bar on level 10 to have any room at all. It was definately worth trying but I would happily pay a fair bit more to stay in a larger room next time. I was the only person in the room - if there had been two of us I would have just left and asked for a refund.,30,May-22,Travelled on business,90,36,Yotel

Good for Solo (or maybe Couple),"I booked this hotel for my staycation after return to Singapore from oversea, I am quite pleased with the overall stay time. The bed is really nice, probably one of the best bed and pillow I ever slept in at hotel. This room, however, is more suitable for single or couple, as the room is small even it is indicate 2pax, it is small and crowded. Also the hand wash /tab sink is locate outside of bathroom, which is a bit weird. But overall is good and location is really awesome. It is an enjoyable stay and I would probably come again when there is promo and good pricing and timing.",50,Apr-22,Undisclosed,3,0,Yotel

Nice hotel but very small room,This hotel is clean and modern. The room is very small for family of 3. The location is good to find foods and go shopping. The room is clean.

Chic and modern looking hotel,"Great location and modern looking hotel. Rooms are with high ceilings and a balcony.  Service level at lobby is mediocre as some of the staff seems cold(don’t even bother to greet or smile). Upon check out, just ushered to use the kiosk although the frontdesk is available. There is no housekeeping during my 3 days 2 nights stay even when I book two King rooms. I felt that at least they should bother to help guests clear their trashbins. The sofa bed was creaking throughout the night if you move. Pretty uncomfortable. Main bed was good but a tad soft.  I love the Komiyumti restaurant as staff was nice, friendly and polite. Welcome drinks was great.",40,Apr-22,Undisclosed,4,2,Yotel
Hit Or Miss,"First the positives: location is excellent at the junction between Orchard and Scotts Road. Plenty of shopping and dining options. Wifi was fast and while there were a lot of rooms, the number of lifts was enough that there was not much waiting to go up or down to the room levels. TV had the usual cable channels covering news and info, movies and entertainment. Now the not so good points: room is small, if you have several pieces of luggage you may have little room to move left. There is no place to sit or work unless you used the luggage rack as a workaround bench. Cleaning is not done daily. We stayed 4 days and the rooms were never cleaned. I don't mind that so much but the trash bin in the room is small and fills up fast. Even if you left it in the hallway, it is not picked…",40,May-22,Travelled with family,198,164,Yotel

The room is very small. The hotel don’t clean up the room in 4 days.,The room is very small. But great location on Orchard road.  We have stayed here for many times and were quite happy earlier.

Short stay cation,"Had a solo staycation at Yotel Singapore. Room was really small and but luckily for me, I didn't have a luggage so it wasn't that bad. Bed had an automatic uplift at the back and that was quite nice as I could watch the TV while sitting up straight. Had quite a few nice channels on the TV so I watched a few movies. Bed was also extremely soft, so I could roll around it and enjoy how fluffy it was. Location was excellent, it was just 5 to 10mins from Orchard mrt station. I managed to buy McDonald's and brought it back to my hotel room. Unfortunately, there was no table or chair so I could only eat on the bed. Toilet was very cool and had a nice large window outside. I like the large window very much. Would definitely go there again.",50,May-21,Travelled solo,25,5,Yotel

Worst Hotel Experience in My Life,"You cant have a better location than this as it is just 2 mins walk to orchard road.  However, the room was absolutely trash. The room was so dirty that we found cockroach in the room (as shown in the photo, there is a Yotel sticker on the switch to prove this was indeed taken in Yotel). This is also the first hotel I have ever been that does not provide housekeeping service. There is a ""please make up my room"" button but the room was not cleaned throughout our 4D3N stay.  Also, the gimmicky bed was a hell for anyone with a spine. The mattress was so soft that when the it was flattened down (there is a switch for you to elevate the head of the bed), it became a C shaped mattress. This was literally worse than lying on the ground, which was not an option due to the limited space…",10,Apr-22,Travelled with family,3,2,Yotel
Staycation at YOTEL,I really like how the hotel looks very futuristic. Cleanliness of the hotel room was what I liked the most. Paid extra for the view and it was worth it. Made a special request for the robot to sing Happy Birthday for my boyfriend and it did happen that was really enjoyable. I love the cabin guide on the television. Really good customer service - they sent a messaging saying that we can check in as early as 7am but due to work we were not able to. Overall a good and memorable stay.,40,Apr-22,Undisclosed,1,0,Yotel

WORST EXPERIENCE,I never recommend this property as a 4 start hotel. The rooms are very small and difficult to accommodate to adults in the room. The wash rooms are also smelly as there was no ventilation provided. You can also hear the sound of other water flows and thereby the feeling you get that you live inside the wash room.   The Bed arrangement is terrible as all the beds in the hotel are folding beds. Therefore you cannot have a comfortable sleep.   The Breakfast was absolutely disastrous as there was no buffet. Even the alacarte menu has no choice and had to experience the same menu for 6 days. ,10,Apr-22,Undisclosed,5,2,Yotel

Repeat Staycation,Chose this hotel due to many considerations. 1. Not operating as a SHN hotel. 2. Value for money. 3. Location. 4. Previous good experiences when staying at this hotel.

Cosy wi,"Did a solo staycation in the Premium Cabin with view, and found the room to very cost and perfect for a single guest looking to spend time alone. Location was tucked behind International Building which kind of hid the hotel but signs from outside was adequate to guide anyone from Orchard MRT to the hotel. In-room equipment were good although the bed could be a little firmer for more comfort, though its understandable due to the reclining aspect of the bed which causes a sunken, deep crease when you recline it fully into a bed. FOX channels on the TV guide should be updated, and the hotel should enable mobile-to-tv cast via same wifi other than the Miracast and screen mirroring (via an app) option.

Food wise, kitchen was not halal and has pork food items so that was a downside. Service and cleanliness was superb. To those who are driving, the carpark does not belong to Yotel so the price of parking fees are super expensive.

It is good that the bed is adjustable to either a sleeping or sitting position but do take note that because of this, the bed has a sunken point (at the point of bending) when bed is in sleeping position. Had a very uncomfortable night sleeping due to this. Aircon also kept adjusting on its own and it got really hot…",40,Mar-22,Undisclosed,2,0,Yotel

Sleek hotel in the heart of Orchard,"Did a staycation over a weekend with my bestie. We were greeted by a very spartan-looking hotel lobby. No grand chandelier hanging over the foyer, or giant floral display. It could be a good or bad thing, depending on who you ask.  I took a GRAB car from my home to the hotel, so I came in from the main driveway. But if you are coming by public transport (Bus/MRT), you can enter the hotel through INTERNATIONAL BUILDING during the mall's opening hours, or walk around the side of INTERNATIONAL BUILDING.  We got the room with the queen bed and upper bunker, so technically the room can accommodate 3 guests. We were supposed to have one more friend, but he had to pull out because he contracted COVID-19.

Big thank you to Conrad + Birthday Celebrations,"A big thank you to Conrad for arranging the birthday staycation for my family member. 4th stay since 2021, having few more upcoming. Booked the bunk bed room, allocated to level 29. Below is my review of the hotel room:  Lobby +Staff are friendly +Safe distancing and temperature taking is enforced by staff Note that deposit of $50 is required for the stay. House keeping only make up room 4 days once. Have some difficulties when staying there for 2 nights. Firstly, have to go to level 1 reception to change the card. Secondly, have to call the housekeeping to change the towel and empty the bins for us.

Better options elsewhere for sure,"Not a fan of writing reviews, but this 4-star hotel experience has really fallen so short that I feel it’s important for everyone who’s considering to stay in Yotel to know. It’s the worst hotel I’ve stayed in, comparable to a 2.5 star hotel service experience. Paid $300 for 1 night at Deluxe Room. The price surge is due to peak / festive booking.

It did take awhile for the concierge to answer our calls but maybe there were busy. The gym was small but clean and it had the essential equipments.

Solo female stay - comfortable with a fabulous toilet view,"Enjoy some me time with a 2D1N stay. Picked this hotel as it was relatively new and location was good.  Kinda surprised the bathroom came with a full view of Orchard road at the back . Very interesting concept. Enjoyed the view , just that when you had to use the toilet / shower , you have to remember to draw the blinds else it would be free entertainment . Though I think the nearest tall Building is a tad too far to really see anything !   Had a queen size bed which was comfortable and it had up/ down buttons to lift the headrest part of the bed which was very useful !   Overall enjoyed the stay , just that I had to queue for an hour just to check In. Check out was a breeze though as majority of other guests just left the premise without doing the proper checking out !",50,Dec-21,Travelled solo,235,48,Yotel

Annual Staycation with Parents,"Check-in was fast - we were able to check-in at 1.30pm instead of the usual 3pm. Despite being on a Friday afternoon, there isn't any snaking queues.

My parents were surprised at how big and roomy the cabin was, especially when they compare it to the Premium Queen Cabin with Bunk. It comes with 2 balconies, one outside the shower, and the other outside the bedroom. The room also comes with a pull-out sofa bed. In all, the room can comfortably accommodate 3 adults.

My 10-year old daughter loved the smartness of the design, especially the bunk bed. Breakfast was not buffet style but the portion was good. The location was ideal as the hotel was liked to international Building and next to Shaw Centre.

The check in process was very slow so you may want to come as early as about 2pm. While it seemed to be a ""smart"" hotel which it was sort of what it is, bear in mind that they only have charging plugs by one side of the bed and if you want extra ports, you may have to go find it around the room which wasn't so convenient.   Tried the pools and thankfully it wasnt fully reserved.

Waited for a whole hour before we even reached the lobby. Self check-in system was utterly rubbish, had to rely on the staff ultimately which probably resulted in the backed-up queue. Would really urge the Management to relook its systems if it wants to market itself as a SmartStay.  Was informed that room wouldn’t be ready until minimally minutes later due to short staff and more stringent checks. Had to store luggage somewhere else as we had other bookings to go to. Apologies from the staff (probably not their fault anyway) but no real action on ratification. Got a call 2 hours after supposed official check-in time at 4PM that room was ready.  Room was pretty small…",30,Nov-21,Undisclosed,1,0,Yotel
Bad experience,"Bad experience, mainly due to the service of the staffs. Check-in time stated was 3pm, so we reached around 2:30pm. There was already a long queue waiting to check-in. Finally our turn to the counter but was told that the rooms are not ready yet. Ended up getting our rooms around 4:30pm. What’s worse is the staff at the front-desk sounded very sarcastic and ingenue. Despite the long wait and delay of check-in, we received a call from the front desk on the day of our check-out saying that there will be a charge if we don’t check-out in the next 10mins. (12:30pm at that point of time, but was told that we could check out at 1pm the day before lol)   Service at the restaurant was also slow and they seem very short handed. Had to wait 30-45mins for our food and even breakfast.   Bed…",10,Nov-21,Undisclosed,1,0,Yotel

YOTEL is generally ok,"Expect the room to be very small, but the view from the room was generally ok, the location is easy to find. The staffs are friendly and helpful except that the staff in their restaurant they serve food slowly. Price wise I'd say such a small room charging almost 200 is a little too high.

Sadly it feel short of my expectations, there wasn’t tt friendliness one would come to expect of the fun Yotel brand. Rooms are poorly upkeep for a relatively young hotel. And cleanliness is horrid. Stains on mirrors. Hair in the sheets. Any hotelier knows that’s a big no-no! Would I go back again? Only if u are looking for an ample room, in a strategic location, on a smaller budget. If not,there are many other hotels ard the same area. ",30,Sep-21,Undisclosed,90,20,Yotel

Staff could do a lot better,"The best thing going for this hotel is its central location in the heart of Orchard Road. Stayed here for 2 nights. Rooms (they call them cabins) are small but decent with modern amenities. However, the biggest disappointment is its staff. They appeared to lack warmth and friendliness. The front desk person I spoke with appeared annoyed when I asked to speak with his duty manager when he could not give me a satisfactory response to an issue encountered with the cabin. A waiter at the Komyuniti restaurant was downright rude in his tone and delivery in telling us we could not sit at a table adjoining that of our friend’s due to prevailing Covid restrictions. These 2 encounters in that short stay of ours did not speak well of the training these staff had received. ",30,Oct-21,Undisclosed,39,7,Yotel

Value for money for the location,Real surprise - nicely tucked behind International Building and easily accessible to the rest of Orchard road. Facilities is basic but really adequate for a stay in Orchard -  interesting concept of 'Mission Control' for the lobby and each room is like a private airplane bunk (with recline-able  bed!) It was a good choice to have a washroom with full floor to ceiling view of the outside - great view of Scott Road and beyond. Otherwise space is limited though not a problem at all for a solo passenger. The next time round would love a room having a view of the Orchard Road side. Food choice seems limited though I do see quite a bit of people dapao-ing.  The two robots Yolanda and Yoshi are quite a novelty - will try to call for their service next time.

Average Experience,We went there for a family staycations but ended up with disappointments. Stuffs were not friendly & kid. Resources looks limited. Not willing to solve customers problems with an extra miles & try to find the fault to charge more. Every thing you will ask will get a robotic answer. May be due to they spend too much times with two robots out there. They should take care their guests properly & front officer should lassie with a manager to solve case by case rather than a robotic answer to all. Otherwise declare it as a budget hotel.

"Good service, uncomfy bed, bad sleep quality. Room extremely small!","I am not sure if the smart bed was supposed to be stuck halfway and not being able to go all the way down or straighten it - which caused me to have back pains after sleeping, thus resulting in really poor sleep quality.   Also, the lack of shower curtains made the stay really inconvenient as I was staying with a friend. Well if you're ok with seeing your friend's body then maybe not a problem for you.   The HDMI/USB port on the wall was also faulty and the engineer told us to connect the HDMI straight to the TV.  The room was already small, putting the laptop on the foldable chair makes walking around the room very very inconvenient.  On top of those listed, the request for amenities needed to wait for an hour because there were only 2 robots.  Supposed to be a staycay to rest,…",20,Sep-21,Undisclosed,3,2,Yotel

Affordable Hotel in the Heart of Orchard Road,"This must be the most affordable out of all decent hotels in the Orchard Area. At slightly over SGD100 which includes breakfast, I certainly have no complaints. The pros were the location… in the  heart of Orchard Road, the cleanliness of the room and the decent breakfast which was part of the Low rate I paid. However, it was not perfect. The bed was far too soft and one of the most uncomfortable hotel beds I’ve slept on in Singapore. Also, due to its affordability, it is a hit among budget conscious staycationers. Expect to wait up to an hour for your check in if you have a Weekend stay like I did!

Uncomfortable bed and poor condition of air-con,The hotel room itself was fine and customer service at front desk was pleasant but what causes the poor rating was the condition of the bed as it was extremely uncomfortable as it was sinking down in the middle which make it hard to sleep.   The aircon in the room wasn’t strong hence it get very hot if we cover with blanket and will even wake up in the middle of the night because it’s was too warm to sleep even without the blanket which was extremely disappointing as next day we felt so restless due to lack of sleep.  The only good thing was the customer service at the front desk. ,20,Oct-21,Undisclosed,3,3,Yotel

The adjustable bed is a nice touch, making for a much more comfortable TV viewing experience from the bed. Great views from the 29th floor with an unblocked view of Singapore.  Housekeeping: Bedsheets were dirty with stains and unknown little solid bits.  The view was slightly marred by the dirty windows (probably from outside)  Housekeeping was only done every 3 days and not daily because of COVID-19. Didn’t really see a logical reasoning behind this but oh well.   Lastly and most alarmingly, found a used pack of condoms on the floor.

From the quick and seamless check-in / check-out done by the Mission Control team (I didn't catch his name but he has green highlights :)) Made me feel welcomed and warm. When I called for disposable cutleries to be sent to the room, the team that answered the call had a friendly tone and as someone who has terrible anxiety with making phone calls, I felt relaxed. I was greeted by the robots and it was a unique experience for me. My experience at the bar was also amazing with friendly service from the bartender and order taker . Cleanliness of room is also immaculate. All in all, a 10/10 from me :) Would definitely recommend YOTEL to my peers! Thank you for the pleasant stay! ",50,Aug-21,Undisclosed,1,0,Yotel
"Smaller room than expected, interesting futuristic concept","Personal card to greet us when we entered. Interesting adjustable bed to sit up and watch tv. Room is smaller than expected, no space to eat food that has been taken back to the hotel, especially with the covid situation- could only order food back, no dine out. TV could not connect and play Netflix from phone. Overall, decent for budget.",30,Jul-21,Undisclosed,25,0,Yotel
Poor stay,Third party booking cancelled our reservation but felt no help was made by the yotel team. Yotel does not know how to handle in terms of cancellation of booking by third party website.

Very good for short stay!,"Generally, I would recommend, especially for 1-2 day stay; not long stay as room may be too small. Pros: Kind staff, Clean, Nice unique view (they upgraded us to 28floor with Orchard view), good location (although hotel entrance not so good), interesting robot.

Yotel Experience,I felt that Yotel Singapore's demographic is catered towards couples as the cabins are quite small and the doors of the shower is slightly visible.

The pool is also not cleaned as there are lots of dry leaves in the pool and the room was quite dusty. ,30,Jul-21,Undisclosed,1,0,Yotel
Staycation.,A nice hotel in a good location. Friendly staff and comfortable bed.

When I needed a lightning cable and HDMI cable for my ipad, the mission control staff were quick to help (though I must say I was fortunate enough to snag a lightning cable before they were all taken). When I asked to spend my $40 F&B voucher over multiple visits to the restaurant rather than all at once as required, the young man speaking over the line made sure that that could happen since I was staying alone and would find it hard to eat and drink $40 worth of food at one go.

Gym has limited facilities but enough for basic workout like weights,treadmills etc. Bed is comfortable and pillows have two types I believe. It is still soft pillows but frankly, harder than many other branded hotels I stayed in. The service is awesome. They wrote a handwritten card and that's not something all hotels invest time in.

Poor Quality Bed and Mattress,"The bed and mattress quality is really bad.  We even tried to sleep with heads on the other end as it is slightly flater than the headside.  We decided to check out about 2am plus, as we were unable to continue using the Smartbed.  To be honest, a good and comfortable bed is the basic for a hotel. This Smartbed fails very poorly in this aspect.   The mattress sinks in on the edge and si­des, does not provide support, same thing for the pillows. The quilt material al­so makes it uncomfor­table to use.  This is something the hotel should review if it wishes to pr­ovide a good stay for the customers.  And we decided to skip the breakfast too even though we had paid for it for 3 pax.  Overall, a very negative experience Staycation at Yotel Singapore!",10,Apr-21,Undisclosed,1,0,Yotel

Memorable Stay,"Though the cabins are small, there were ample walking space due to their smart layout. The rooms with view was fantastic! We celebrated my husband's birthday there and the hotel very kindly sent Yolanda (their robot) up to our room and sang a birthday song for my husband before presenting him with some macaroons and a birthday card signed by all the staff of Yotel! Very impressive!",40,Feb-21,Undisclosed,1,0,Yotel

Perfect place,"Perfect place to unwind and relax. Highly recommended for couples for its convenience and space. Very smart way to save space and wasn't too congested.

Short Staycation,"Took the First Class Queen and loved the balcony and the view! The check in was seamless despite being the public holiday period and the check in staff was really friendly and polite. However, the bed was too soft so did not really sleep very well and also, should consider having non smoking balconies so those who cannot take second hand smoke can have the option of choosing that. If not, if the next door cabin guests smoke at their balcony, it will cause discomfort to those who do mind the second hand smoke. ",30,Feb-21,Undisclosed,15,25,Yotel
CNY Staycation,Booked this hotel for a family staycation of 3 adults. Given the cabin room with bunk bed. Location is prime as in the heart of Orchard Shopping Belt.  Cabin room is well compacted but size is really too small for a family of 3 - very squeezy . ,30,Feb-21,Undisclosed,1,0,Yotel
Poor cleanliness,The price of the hotel and the service of the staff were fine. The rest of the stuff such as the cleanliness of the room and facilities were bad. Given 2 rooms but both were dusty.

Upon arriving at the hotel, we were welcomed by a clean, quiet and sleek view of the lobby - self service kiosks on the left, robots on the right and service counters in front of us. The premium view bunk room is an experience, but slightly small for a 3 pax. Nonetheless, the high floor view on beside the bathroom/ toilet is certainly pleasing and satisfying.

The location is conveniently located just a stone's throw from Orchard MRT and the major shopping malls which line the area. I loved how simple the concept is. We felt safe throughout the check-in process. We loved the robots that delivered water to the room. It was my partner's birthday so it was a surprise when a robot delivered a birthday card for him. Absolutely would love to stay here again for a budget staycation in the Orchard area. Shop 'til you drop... into one of the rooms. Also, Komyuniti is a welcome surprise. Quiet ambiance.

Small room with everything provided,I really like the adjustable bed and how comfortable it is. The view from the shower was nice too. Just that the aircon is not cold enough when we are sleeping and the swimming pool water is icy cold for me.,50,Feb-21,Undisclosed,8,10,Yotel
Floor to ceiling bathroom windows,"With the floor to ceiling bathroom windows in their cabins, the shower experience at Yotel was probably the most memorable. Their cabins were very simple, functional and fulfil their brand promise of only focusing on providing the essentials. I slept well on their mattress. Though I have to say that service standards here are rather unremarkable. The purple lighting used around the property serves as quite a backdrop for the now necessary Instagram shot when on staycation. Check-in and out was quick and smooth without much hassle. Recommended if you are just looking for a self-sufficient, simple and value for money staycation experience in a time when leisure overseas travel is practically not possible.",30,Nov-20,Undisclosed,82,45,Yotel

Reasonable price for a fantastic location,"For 3 guests, you couldn’t find a better hotel at this price for such a fantastic location. Right next door is the start of the shopping belt Orchard Road. However, bear in mind that the rooms are really small. The so-called room with a view is when you have to keep the toilet door opened then you are able to have a view. Once the toilet door is closed, it is really that’s it! A cabin! ",40,Jan-21,Undisclosed,25,42,Yotel

Nice hotel in prime shopping location,"This is the 2nd hotel in Orchard Road that i have tried in 2021 and is newer than the other one i have tried.   Was given Room#2814. Despite room size is small, everything in the room is neat and tidy.  Given a nice city view in the toilet but don't forget to bring down the bind before you do your business. Room door is thick thus i did not hear any noise from the hotel corridor. Nice smart bed that you can adjust the angle while watching TV on bed. Water pressure from shower head is good but the only issue i have is the glass toilet door. If you are staying with another person you be able to see him/her sitting on toilet bowl, as the toilet door cannot be closed fully.

Robocation,My kids loved Yoshi and Yolanda very much. Only thing is that Yolanda sings a goodbye tune but Yoshi just say good bye. Thus its better to get the female robot to deliver items to the room. It was raining in the 3 days we stayed there thus the water in the swimming pool was cold. But that did not stop the kids from going into the pool when the rain stopped for a while. Overall the kids enjoyed themselves. ,50,Jan-21,Undisclosed,1,0,Yotel
review from Nyan desu,"Room was small upon first impression but the futuristic interior design was thought through, having smartbeds/tv to utilizing space very well (that a full-length ironing board could fit in without cramming the place). Full bottles of shampoo/conditioner etc were surprisingly provided instead of your typical small samples, and the toilet was so clean and cosy w a view of the cityscape and hot water (don't worry you can pull the blinds down for privacy when taking a dump).  YOSHI the robot was so cute and had a personality: It went, ""May the force be with you"" and ""Hasta La Vista, baby"". Didn't manage to meet YOLANDA though :( We had trouble trying to connect our device to the tv (it only streamed music and not videos??) so would be useful to have a thorough guide somewhere.…",40,Jan-21,Undisclosed,1,0,Yotel

Decent,"I love the view, style and amenities of Yotel. Great location to access Orchard and train stations. When the hotel first opened the beds were in great condition, but recent visits shows the bed have sunken quite a bit. They missed out to replenish some amenities but were quick to recover after a call. As for their front liners, service seriously varies greatly from one another. The way they communicate COVID measures were not the most tactful. They have self-automated machines but at the end still require a staff to assist you or else end up diverting you to the counters, not a very smart check in after all.",30,Nov-20,Travelled as a couple,8,4,Yotel
Noisy water pipes,"My husband and I booked a 3d2n stay to celebrate the New Year countdown to 2021. The room was very clean and I really liked the retractable bed. We had a high floor hence we had a good view of the orchard area surroundings. However, I think the design of the room is very bad/not soundproof as I could hear water flushing down the pipe whenever the guests above uses the toilet/bathe. It happened in the day and we thought nothing of it. However, we didn’t realised how loud it was that we got awaken up at 3am by the water flowing through the pipes and it lasted about an hour!

Decent enough stay,"Comfortable as an overview review of the 3D2N stay in Yotel. Transport and convenience (to find food , shopping) is not a concern as everything is highly accessible. The premium queen room is relatively snug with not much space to sit down and have a meal in the room. The design of the room is slightly awkward as the window is in the bathroom. Hence , the blinds had to be wind up and down before and after usage of the bathroom. The sink is right next to the bed , might not be the best if you are not staying alone and your partner is a light sleeper. There is no proper table or space to be used to sit down and have a meal together in the room. Breakfast is average but still decent , with savoury and sweet options offered.

staycation,"Hotel looks good on the outside. Was easy to find due to the directional signs as well. The room was small, but functional. Bed is a little too soft, but understandable due to its availability to fold. Breakfast offering was dismal, but it probably has to do with the covid situation. Special mention to Aaron at checkin, who noted the birthday of my partner and made a birthday greeting. Also, the birthday surprise and card sent up to the room was a very nice touch. Thanks to the staff who took the effort to sign on the card (Mel, Adoncia (hope I got this right) and a third whose handwriting i am unable to identify).

Short Staycation,"Brought my family and my parents for a short staycation in this hotel. Reason I chose this hotel is because of its convenient location. There was a long queue during check in but I was cleared within 30mins.  Staff were friendly and warm and we felt welcomed. Our room was clean and I love the purple colour.  Our bathroom had a view of the Xmas lights 😊  However, the bed was too soft, I didn’t had a good night sleep though.  Overall, I would recommend this hotel and kudos to the management!",40,Dec-20,Undisclosed,56,28,Yotel
An interesting experience in Yotel.,The management was flexible with the check-in timing. It was seamless and we did not have to wait for long to check in to our cabins. The location was excellent and the robots was an interesting experience. Even though the cabin was not big but its practical and had whatever we needed in a room. The cabin was clean and the view from the toilet was amazing!,50,Dec-20,Undisclosed,1,0,Yotel

Staycation,Comfortable stay located in a prime district (town). Accessible to bus & mrt within a short walk. Great food all over the place too. However cabins are quite cramped even for couple.

Comfortable & Clean,Tried Yotel once in New York 5 years back so we already knew what we gonna expect. Check in was at 3pm and the q took us around 45mins to complete the whole process. Cabin was clean and spotless. Pillows were too soft for us. Comfortable bed which can be adjusted if you want to lay back and watch tv. The tv was great with lots of channels and you are able to cast from your phone. Very cool! Toilet comes with a bidet which is a plus point. ,50,Nov-20,Travelled as a couple,74,24,Yotel
Recommended :),"I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a short getaway. The room is relatively small but still provides everything you need to stay there comfortably.

Best decision to end 2020,"Although the room was small for 3 persons, it was a great price for our 3D2N staycay + breakfasts. It's very accessible from Orchard, the room was very clean, and we loved our stay. We brought a Nintendo Switch to play and connect to their big screen, and lots of board games. Would recommend! Only one downside is they seem understaffed, so both check in and check out, as well as breakfast queues can be quite long (i.e. about 30mins wait). Oh yes, and their were a bit too soft for our liking and our backs.",50,Dec-20,Undisclosed,1,0,Yotel

Staycation VIP King Suite,"The VIP King Suite is nice, boasting 2 balconies that have awesome views over the Orchard Rd area. Has a king sized bed and a living room sofa bed and a dining table. The bathroom drainage had an issue though and the bathroom was constantly flooded.   Breakfast was not bad but the queue was very long. They should stagger the timings for breakfasts and perhaps inform me earlier that there was an option for takeaway or delivery to our rooms.   Overall, for the price, I guess it's good value for money considering the location and good views. ",40,Dec-20,Undisclosed,24,7,Yotel

Innovative themed robotel,"As the picture speaks for itself, we were well greeted with a long queue upon arrival. The turnover of rooms does move pretty consistent, so do prepare to wait awhile or show up slightly early.  Fairly new hotel with well equipped amenities. The selling point will be most rooms start from high floor (L18 and above?) and with full window view. Room is small but fully equipped with basic amenities.  Couple of cons will be on the pool/gym booking were not clearly explained upon check in. Room does not seems to be sound proofed, from party rooms beside us. With all the ups and downs, I'm still pleased with this stay and is worth if you're considering a short stay.",40,Oct-20,Undisclosed,48,51,Yotel

But other than that, location was awesome (right smack in the middle of orchard road with a lot of amenities and food places nearby, also very easy to travel to other parts of town. Just take the buses infront of the Thai embassy) .   Cabin was small but spacious. Love the full length windows in the toilet ( spent so much time in there just looking outside lol) . The windows also really helped to expand the space in the room. Sleep was comfortable and great! The only gripe I have was that housekeeping is done every 3 days.

My stay in First Class King ( Junior Suite) at futuristic hotel.,"It was my 2nd visit to Yotel. I went to lobby. People must queue to scan Safe Entry, then filled in questionaire and then temperature taking. Then people must queue up to check in.  During COV-19, no self-check in.  After few minutes waiting, I paid and was given a keycard . I then went to 30 th storey. I was impressed with First Class King. (got nice coffee machine and sofa, coffee table. even the worktable was large and chair was nice) . Very much better than my previous room - First Class Queen. (just a Premium Queen cabin with balcony.)  However, I am not impressed with the toilet and shower lighting. At night, it was abit dark to use shower and toilet, or even brush my teeth.

The check-in was relatively fast though we had to pay a $50 deposit which would be refunded upon check-out if you did not order food or drinks at their restaurant. The cabin (Yotel names their rooms ""cabins"") is small but compact with space-saving storage blended into the wall and furniture. The bathroom is surprisingly quite spacious with rain shower and fragrant shower gel and shampoo. The hand-sanitizer and wet wipes are a nice touch to the stay.

Birthday staycation,"The hotel was nice and clean, like any 4 star hotel. When we checked in, the front office wished my gf happy birthday as it was her birthday. I thought that was plus point as he gave extra attention to details. As I read other comments from other trip advisor reviews, I saw that Yotel would prepare small birthday suprises but my gf never received one. It would’ve been a star above other 4 star hotel if they put in a little extra effort of service to suprise my gf for her birthday.

Great location with clean rooms,Booked a 1 night stay in this hotel and was extremely satisfied with the room and services.  I booked a room with a balcony included and was pleasantly surprised on how clean it is. Not that I expect it to be full of trash but I find it to be spotless. Some 5 star hotels can't even match this level of cleanliness.  The room was small but I can't complain because they advertised the size of the room through their website. I don't understand why some people can complain of rooms being so small when the dimensions are already being shown in the website.  One point to note is that their bed is not exactly comfortable. Younger folks may not notice but older couples may find it uncomfortable.  Breakfast was provided via takeaway as I believe their restaurant is undergoing renovation.…,50,Sep-20,Undisclosed,54,53,Yotel

Another station, whom I believed a korean staff manning it, took forever to check in.

Location is great but not the room,"Stayed on 19sept to 20sept. Room type: first class queen.  Starting with the check-in process, due to COVID-19 there is a need for safe entry and such. This is something that I am not reviewing as back but good. So 1 star for it.  Location is great for local and tourists in future as town is just at your doorstep. So 1 star for it.  Staff in the hotel are friendly and helpful so another 1 star for it.  Here is the area that had lack. Normally I would put at least 2 stars into the room.  Room space is terrible. Once we open the door, my wife had to go in first and move to the right then I go in then we can close the door and proceed to the other part. Pretty unsafe to me.

CONs:  More suitable for leisure traveler for a short stay of 1-2 days as the room size is too small. If you have lots of big luggages or have kids with you, unless you booked the bigger room, you're going to struggle. No writing desk in the room, business travellers be warned.

That being said, this is not a hotel for you to spend the entire day in. This is a hotel perfect if you want to spend the entire day outside, take advantage of its location and go back to a comfortable and clean place to sleep.

There was a Long queue that formed all the way to the outside of the hotel.  Not high tech at all as it is advertised to be.   Every person that enters the hotel each time had to record their time in , room number and body temperature on a piece of paper with a pen that is shared which the hotel did not bother to change or clean.

The pillow was way too soft for my wife and I while the mattress seems to have a dent on my side of the bed that made me have backaches on top of my neck and shoulder aches the pillows gave us.

It even had an iron and ironing board (we even used it!) and the bed tucking away a bit made even more room.

Everything else is good to reach - cabs are reasonable in Singapore. The cab to the airport was 20 SD. Also used the gym which is rather small and feels full with two people working out. Over all a good stay though. ",40,Feb-20,Undisclosed,32,38,Yotel

Good Location But Room is Small,The staff at the front desk are polite. I was at the hotel in the morning around 9am and had to leave my lugguage with them. After the necessary paperwork he indicated all is good. I asked if I can get the room key around 1pm and had to ask if they will pass me a receipt for the lugguage they are holding for me. He actually forgot to pass me the receipt.   Room is clean and quiet. But it is a little small. I had only 1 small carry on lugguage and a back pack. So it wasn’t too bad. If there were 2 guests in the room with 2 lugguages it would be cramp with little space for movement.   The bathroom has a good open view although you should draw down the blinds for privacy as it faces various buildings nearby.   Location of the hotel is great.

Excellent in every way,"I spent 6 nights here and could have stayed for many more. I was travelling solo, and had a double room but I paid extra for the view. Would highly recommended paying extra for the view, as it just added another element to enjoy. The room was compact but had everything I needed, and as a solo traveller I felt really safe. The location was extremely convenient, particularly in regards to how close the hotel is to Orchard mrt. The only thing I'd mention, while not an issue, was that the bed is made of something like memory foam, which tended to stay moulded in the shape of my body while sleeping - something that could be an issue if you are needing more back support. I found the bed very comfortable though overall and the layout of the room to be very well organised. The staff…",50,Feb-20,Undisclosed,2,4,Yotel

Great modern hotel in central Singapore,"This is a great hotel if you want to be in the middle of the busiest shopping area of Singapore. My only complaint is the food facilities; breakfast is free if you book direct at their website and other third party websites had breakfast included in their rates. As a result, breakfast was always busy with too little seats and long queues at the egg station. But it doesn't matter because it's Singapore and a great breakfast can be had at any of the shopping centres for a cheap price so we just went out to have breakfast ourselves after the first two days.

Our room was not so big , but with a queen bed that had a single bunk above it was big enough for 3 people. The bathroom facilities were also very good.

I was not offered anything additional and was not even offered an apology by the staff or management.

Location is superb,"Location this hotel was superb ... oposite Ion Ocrhard and beside I setan shaw house, many restaurant near this hotel so don't worry about it. if you go only solo travel or couple travelling this hotel was ok, but if you go with your family and kids, I think you have a concern about size the room.",40,Dec-19,Undisclosed,6,13,Yotel
Quirky Concept,Space age concept. Very comfy bed and awesome views from the 30th floor. Not your average hotel room and as a mature couple not sure it was perfect for us.

Couldn't swing a cat,"I know they say so in the advert but geez the room is small. It's clean and functional as the brief describes however place two above average sized humans plus luggage into the mix and it becomes a jigsaw puzzle. The hotel is well located and check-in and out is seamless so the concept is great, just poor in practice.  Also, as the bed folds, it is soft and does not breathe and none from out group enjoyed a pleasant night's sleep, which is all we needed the room for.",30,Jan-20,Undisclosed,53,53,Yotel
"Looks cool, however, after staying there, I would not recommend it.","The hotel itself is very cool. The robots were an unusual touch, and getting room service from there was a unique experience. The novelty does wear off after a while though. The location was great, the room was sparkling clean. However  there were a few things because of which I would not recommend it - the bed was too soft and too small (even though we are definitely average sized, or could even be considered small), the aircon was kind of confusing to reach an optimum level. All this affected the quality of our sleep. And moreover, the view for which there is a premium is from a bathroom which cannot stay open if you want to use it (public nudity is a punishable offence in Singapore and it is considered public nudity if you can be seen nude from a window).

I was expecting a more capsule hotel like experience, where you are not really closed off from other guests, and you have more of a reclining lounger rather than a flat bed. I had an experience on a layover in Abu Dhabi in such a capsule hotel, it was nice to be able to partially lie down, but still it was not totally relaxing hehe. So that was what I was expecting.  This is a real room all to oneself, closed door, bathroom, shower, full flat COMFORTABLE bed for 2 people. It's not huge, so don't expect that.

Clean hotel and good location but very small room,"As soon as we stepped in the room we felt like we were in a prison cell. Very small room. Our room was supposed to be with a view but the view we had wasn't like the photo. We stayed on 21st floor.  For some reason I could smell urine whenever our room was cleaned. I wonder that's because they cleaned the room with the cleaning equipment which was also used to clean the bathroom. However it appeared the housekeeping team did a good job. Mind you though, your bed sheet will be changed on the 4th day.  Overall it was a value for money hotel in Orchard road but I'll stay somewhere else next time mainly because it is too small sized room.  ",40,Dec-19,Undisclosed,1,2,Yotel

I highly recommend the hotel for solo traveler or couples because there’s no room for children , maybe ask for their suite if you’re travelling with children.",40,Nov-19,Undisclosed,475,173,Yotel
A nice compact hotel for who love to be around orchard,"This hotel has a nice location nearest mall is whellock place or shaw. In shaw basement already has many food options for you to choose. The room is enough for two, a little hassle if you bring big luggage. The bed is comfy, the room is quiet but if there is people on the hall you will slightly hear them. Bathroom is okay, pack with amenities you need. So yeah this hotel is so nice, for the money too.",40,Nov-19,Undisclosed,2,4,Yotel

a very descent stay with reasonable price,"The premium queen room that i stayed in, was absolutely clean, this hotel definitely has the best record in cleanliness and service. i have stayed in this lovely hotel twice in my previous visits to singapore and will definitely go back again for the third time.

BUT they were very sad that the ROBOT NOT WORKING (had some issue) while we were staying (from 16 Nov to 19 Nov ).. My 3 children were very very sad..

Really clean and comfortable room with stunning floor to ceiling view of the city outside. We were facing Orchard Road and it was cool to see the bustle of one of Singapore's busiest streets. The robots are also a unique feature that we haven't experienced before.   Location is great as you're right on Orchard Road for shopping and restaurants. It's also less than a minutes walk to the closest MRT (Orchard) through the Ion Mall.   We stayed for 10 nights and the hotel provided free drinks at their Komyuniti bar on our tenth night as a thank you for staying with them which was a nice touch. Everyone we dealt with for check in/out, recommendations and booking taxi's was very friendly and helpful.",50,Nov-19,Undisclosed,34,46,Yotel

Great novel Hotel Experience,Checked in late for one night on way through. Had read about brand and was curious.  Room is very small but very well designed and appointed.

Shower ample big enough with great soaps and view or windos for exhibition. Gold. Breakfast was also very good with ample choices.

Average Stay,Following our recent stay at Yotel Singapore I can say the experience was very average. Pros of the hotel are that you get the room made up everyday and bottles of water also. Given the hotel is relatively inexpensive it is nice to see these basics taken care of. The negatives of the hotel are the rooms struggling to get cold the aircon has a lowest temperature of 21c and cannot be turned lower. The staff also could have been more helpful at times rather than the stand off approach they decided to take on the occasions they were needed. Overall the hotel is in a good location and if you are looking purely for a bed for the night it would suffice otherwise there are nicer hotels in the area within the same budget ,30,Nov-19,Undisclosed,19,43,Yotel

Horrible experince but great location!!!,An absolutely horrible experience. We had fully paid for a room for five nights which they gave away to someone else as we were late to check in. The pushed us into a room category that was not what we had paid for and they did this without informing us. When I took it up with them all they did was make excuses and told lies that they had informed us.  All in all a horrible expericence. Would not wish it on my worst enemy.,10,Nov-19,Undisclosed,61,50,Yotel
Fantastic Place to Stay,"We stayed 4 days here. Check in was quick and this was at 10:30am. They had a room ready. The rooms are very unique, we had a small room with a bunk bed, small but very serviceable. They have robots that take care of room service. The breakfast was very good. The restaurant is on the 10 floor. Yotel is a quarter block off Orchard Road, with a very big mall 5 min walk from the hotel.with lots of cafe, restaurant and coffee shop in are around the area.The hop-on hop-off stop is 2 min walk in either direction, Cannot say enough good thing about the staff or this hotel.

Lack of Privacy + Small rooms,rooms too small and Didn't feel private. Felt like i had to be hyper aware everytime i opened the front door cos the first thing people walking by see is your bed.

Good location and hotel but small ,"Location is the best aspect of this hotel as it’s located in a central location where it is easy to access the metro.  The hotel is very clean and staff are helpful. However, the rooms are very small! The design is modern and quirky with a bed that moves and storage is cleverly designed however there is very little storage and once you have your luggage open there is very little space!  Breakfast has a fairly good variety and everything you need, option to sit outside for breakfast is nice.  Rooftop pool is nice but it is quite small. ",40,Nov-19,Undisclosed,18,22,Yotel

The furniture was minimalist, compact but the bed and the bunk are really good and comfy. Despite the small size, shower room are big, with a blurry glass wall.  If you stay with the kids, they will love the 2 helper robots. Too bad we didn't got the chance to try them The breakfast also great, located at the 10th floor, you can see pool area from here.",50,Jul-19,Undisclosed,68,45,Yotel
Compact but complete,"Yes, the rooms are small, BUT they have everything you need!  Kettle, tea/coffee (creamer instead of milk though - not so nice for us tea drinkers), USB charging ports, water, and a very comfortable bed with a nice tilt option.

Adequate breakfast buffet - nothing to rave about but the options were reasonable and complementary which was appreciated.  Very friendly reception staff.  I'd definitely stay here again.  12noon checkout much appreciated - and I was offered 1pm which really suited me as I was heading out at 12.30pm. Quiet.  Great night's sleep!

I was quite pissed and was wonder why is she insisted I register for the second guest until I told her I always asked for two cards for one person stay, and I am a regular guest to this hotel...

Top of mind hotel whenever i am traveling to SG,So convenient with lots of shopping mall and food place. Highly recommend for single travelers because bed is queen size instead of king bed.

Friendly staff and clean hotel,"I had a nice stay in Yotel Singapore. Their staff were friendly and efficient, including the robots Yolanda and Yoshi. I like that they use big bottles for their shampoo, conditioner and hand/body wash in order to minimize trash. The room where I stayed in was quite small but it was clean and basically had everything I needed for a 1-week stay. However, it would be better if they could provide bidet hosts in their toilet since not all people can get by just by using toilet paper.  Moreover, they could add some more food selection in their restaurant (Komyuniti).",40,Oct-19,Undisclosed,1,2,Yotel

Futuristic too because of the awesome skyline view over Singapore, shower while sticky-beaking across the island :) Friendly - the staff are really great, and went out of their way to help when asked for assistance - a big plus to making our stay memorable, enjoyable and likely to return.
